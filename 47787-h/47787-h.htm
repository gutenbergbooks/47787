<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The rules laid down for this edition have been
fully stated in the Introduction. It need only be
said here that these have been scrupulously followed.</p>

<p>I may take this opportunity of saying that the
text gives Aubrey's quotations, English and Latin
alike, in the form in which they are found in his
MSS. They are plainly cited from memory, not
from book: they frequently do not scan, and at
times do not even construe. A few are incorrect
cementings of odd half lines.</p>

<p>The necessary excisions have not been numerous.
They suggest two reflections. The turbulence
attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh seems to have made
his name in the next age the centre of aggregation
of quite a number of coarse stories. In the same
way, Aubrey is generally nasty when he mentions
the noble house of Herbert, earl of Pembroke, and
the allied family of Sydney. There may be personal
pique in this, for Aubrey thinks he had a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
escape from assassination by a Herbert (i. 48);
perhaps also there may be the after-glow of a
Wiltshire 'feud' (i. 316).</p>

<p>The Index gives all references to persons mentioned
in the text, except to a few found only in
pedigrees, or otherwise quite insignificant; also to
all places of which anything distinctive is said.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS OF THE 'LIVES'</h2>


<p>In the text the Lives have been given in alphabetical order
of the names. This was necessary, not only on account of their
number&mdash;more than 400&mdash;but because Aubrey, in compiling
them, followed more than one principle of selection, writing,
first, lives of authors, then, lives of mathematicians, but bringing
in also lives of statesmen, soldiers, people of fashion, and
personal friends.</p>

<p>The following synopsis of the lives may serve to show (i) the
heads under which they naturally fall, (ii) their chronological
sequence.</p>

<p>The mark &#8224; indicates the year or approximate year of death;
&#8225; denotes a life which Aubrey said he would write, but which
has not been found; &sect; is attached to the few names of
foreigners.</p>

<p class="ph1">AUBREY'S 'BRIEF LIVES'</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">I. Origin of the 'Lives.'</span></h3>

<p>Aubrey sought and obtained an introduction to Anthony
Wood in August 1667. He was keenly interested in
antiquarian studies, and had the warmest love for Oxford;
he had been a contemporary in Trinity College with
Wood's brother, Edward; and so was drawn to Wood
on hearing that he was busy with researches into the
History of the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>Aubrey was one of those eminently good-natured men,
who are very slothful in their own affairs, but spare no
pains to work for a friend. He offered his help to Wood;
and, when it was decided to include in Wood's book short
notices of writers connected with Oxford, that help proved
most valuable. Aubrey, through his family and family-connexions,
and by reason of his restless goings-to-and-fro,
had a wide circle of acquaintance among squires and
parsons, lawyers and doctors, merchants and politicians,
men of letters and persons of quality, both in town and
country. He had been, until his estate was squandered, an
extensive and curious buyer of books and MSS. And
above all, being a good gossip, he had used to the
utmost those opportunities of inquiry about men and
things which had been afforded him by societies grave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
like the Royal Society, and frivolous, as coffee-house
gatherings and tavern clubs. The scanty excerpts, given
in these volumes, from letters written by him between
1668 and 1673, supply a hint of how deeply Wood's
<i>Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis</i>, published
in 1674, was indebted to the multifarious memory and
unwearying inquiries of the enthusiastic Aubrey.</p>

<p>Dean Fell's request that Wood should notice Oxford
writers and bishops in his <i>Historia</i> had suggested to Wood
the plan of, and set him to work upon, the larger and
happier scheme of the <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i>, an 'exact
history of all the writers and bishops that have had their
education in ... Oxford' since 1500. He engaged his
friend Aubrey to help him in his undertaking, by committing
to writing in a more systematic way, for Wood's
benefit, his multitudinous recollections of men and books.
He was dexterous enough to supply the additional motive,
that, after serving his friend's turn, Aubrey's collections
might be gathered together, preserved for a while in some
safe and secret place, and, when personal feelings were
saved by lapse of time, be published and secure their
writer a niche in the Temple of Fame.</p>

<p>It was now by no means easy for Aubrey to undertake
any extensive, and especially any connected work. Being
by this time bankrupt, and a hanger-on at the tables of
kindred and acquaintances, he had to fall in with his
patrons' habits, at the houses where he visited; to sit with
them till they wearied of their carousings in the small
hours of the morning; and to do his writing next forenoon,
before they had slept off their wine.</p>

<p>Still, his interest in the subject, and his desire to help
his friend prevailed; and we soon find him thanking Wood
for setting him to work. March 27, 1680<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:&mdash;''Twill be
a pretty thing, and I am glad you putt me on it. I doe
it playingly. This morning being up by 10, I writt two
&lt;lives&gt;: one was Sir John Suckling<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, of whom I wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>a leafe and &frac12; in folio.' May 22, 1680<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>:&mdash;'My memoires
of lives' &lt;is now&gt; 'a booke of 2 quires, close written: and
after I had began it, I had such an impulse on my spirit
that I could not be at quiet till I had donne it.' Sept. 8,
1680<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>:&mdash;'My booke of lives ... they will be in all about
six-score, and I beleeve never any in England were
delivered so faithfully and with so good authority.'</p>

<p>Aubrey, therefore, began these lives<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on the suggestion
of, and with a desire to help Anthony Wood.</p>

<p>Among the lives so written were several of mathematicians
and men of science. And another friend of
Aubrey's, Dr. Richard Blackburne, advised him to collect
these by themselves, and add others to them, with a view
to a biographical history of mathematical studies in
England. To this suggestion Aubrey was predisposed
through his pride at being 'Fellow of the Royal Society,'
and for some time he busied himself in that direction<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>In the same way, although the bulky life of Thomas
Hobbes<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was partly undertaken in fulfilment of a promise
to Hobbes himself, an old personal friend, the motive
which induced Aubrey to go on with it was a desire to
supply Dr. Blackburne with material for a Latin biography,
<i>Vitae Hobbianae Auctarium</i>, published in 1681.</p>

<p>These matters will be found more fully explained in the
notices which Aubrey has prefixed to the several MSS. of
his biographical collections, as described below.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">II. Condition of the Text of the 'Lives.'</span></h3>

<p>Few of the 'Lives' are found in a fair copy<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Again
and again, in his letters to Anthony Wood, Aubrey makes
confession of the deficiencies of his copy, but puts off the
heavy task of reducing it to shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>His method of composition was as follows. He had
a folio MS. book, and wrote at the top of a page here and
there the name of a poet, or statesman, or the like, whose
life he thought of committing to paper. Then, selecting
a page and a name, he wrote down hastily, without notes
or books, his recollections of the man, his personal appearance,
his friendships, his actions or his books. If
a date, a name, a title of a book, did not occur to him on
the spur of the moment, he just left a blank, or put a mark
of omission (generally, ... or&mdash;&mdash;), and went on. If the
matter which came to him was too much for the page, he
made an effort to get it in somehow, in the margins (top,
bottom, or sides), between the paragraphs, or on the
opposite page.</p>

<p>When he read over what he had written in the first glow
of composition, he erased, wrote alternatives to words and
phrases, marked words, sentences, and paragraphs for
transposition, inserted queries: unsettled everything.</p>

<p>If later on, from books or persons, he got further information,
he was reckless as to how he put in the new
matter: sometimes he put it in the margin, sometimes
at a wrong place in the text, or on a wrong leaf, or in the
middle even of another life, and often, of course, in a
different volume.</p>

<p>And there, as has been said, the copy was left. Very
seldom was a revised copy made.</p>

<p>To the confusions unavoidable in composing after this
fashion, must be added the unsteadiness consequent on
writing in the midst of morning sickness after a night's
debauch. One passage, in which he describes his difficulties
in composing, explains, in a way nothing else could, the
frequent erasures, repetitions, half-made or inconsistent
corrections, and dropping of letters, syllables, and words,
which abound in his MSS. March 19, 1680/1<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; 'if I had but
either one to come to me in a morning with a good scourge,
or did not sitt-up till one or two with Mr. &lt;Edmund&gt; Wyld,
I could doe a great deal of businesse.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">III. Aim of this Edition.</span></h3>

<p>In presenting a text of Aubrey's 'Lives,' an editor, on
more than one important point, has to decide between
alternatives.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Shall all, or some only, of the lives be given?</p>

<p>It is plain, from a glance over the MSS., that many of
the lives are of little interest; in some cases, because they
contain more marks of omission than statements of fact; in
other cases, because they give mainly excerpts from prefaces
of books; and so on. A much more interesting, as well as
handier, book would be produced, if the editor were to
reject all lives in which Aubrey has nothing of intrinsic
value to show.</p>

<p>2. In the lives selected, shall the whole, or parts only, of
what Aubrey has written be given?</p>

<p>Many sentences occur, which declare only Aubrey's
ignorance of a date, or a place, or the title of a book. In
other cases, dull and imperfect catalogues of writings are
given. The omission of these would be a service to the
whole, like the cutting of dead branches out of a shrub.</p>

<p>3. In constituting the text, how much, or how little,
notice is to be taken of the imperfections of Aubrey's
copy?</p>

<p>The simplest, and, from some points of view, the most
effective, course would be to treat Aubrey's rough draft as
if it were one's own, rejecting (without comment) one or
other of two alternatives, supplying (without mark) a
missing word or date, omitting a second version (though
having some minor peculiarities) of a statement, and so on.
In this way, with a minimum of trouble to the editor,
a smooth text would be produced, which would spare the
reader much irritation.</p>

<p>4. How far is the text to be annotated, the editor
supplying Aubrey's abundant omissions, and correcting his
many mistakes?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect of all these questions, the aim of the present
edition, and the reasons for the decision taken in each case,
can be stated very briefly and decidedly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1, and 2. This edition seeks to give in full all that
Aubrey has written in his four chief MSS. of biographies,
MSS. Aubrey 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>The entire contents of these MSS. will thus be placed
beyond that risk of perishing, to which they must have
remained liable so long as they were found only in MS.,
and they will, for what they are worth, henceforth be
accessible to all.</p>

<p>Some things in Aubrey's writing offend not merely
against our present canons of good taste, but against good
morals. The conversation of the people among whom
Aubrey moved, although they were gentry both in position
and in education, was often vulgar, and occasionally foul,
as judged by us. I have dealt with these lives as historical
documents, leaving them, with a very few excisions, to
bear, unchecked, their testimony as to the manners and
morals of Restoration England.</p>

<p>3. This edition seeks to present faithfully Aubrey's
text as he wrote it, neglecting only absolute minutiae.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A plain text is given of what Aubrey wrote, taking,
as seemed most convenient, sometimes his first version of
a sentence or a word, sometimes his alternative version.
The rejected alternatives are given in the textual notes, as
'duplicate with'; and occasionally the erasures, as 'substituted
for.' Many of these notes are very trivial; but
their presence, which after all gives little trouble, provides
a complete view of the MS. text. I believe also that in
this way I have preserved for the collector of words some
quaint forms and expressions for which he will thank me,
and provided the student of English style with some apt
instances of the way in which terse native words have been
replaced in our written language by feebler Latinisms.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) I have been careful to give, in every case, Aubrey's
own spelling, with or without final or medial 'e,' with single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
or double letters, 'ie' or other diphthong where we write
'ei,' and the like. The English of Aubrey's age is so like
our own that it is not unimportant to mark even its minor
differences.</p>

<p>All merely artificial tricks of writing (w<sup>ch</sup> for which, and
the like) have been neglected.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Where a date, a word, or a name has been inserted,
the insertion is enclosed in angular brackets &lt; &gt;.
Where it seemed requisite to mark that a word or phrase
was added at a later date, or by another hand, square
brackets have been used []. The use of these symbols,
borrowed from Vahlen's edition of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, has
been censured as pedantic, but I know of no clearer or
shorter way of making plain in a printed text just what is,
and what is not, in the MS. text.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Punctuation is generally absent in Aubrey's text, as
might be expected, and where it is found, it is often misleading.
The points and marks in this edition are therefore
such as seemed to make the meaning clear to myself, and
therefore, I hope, to others.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) As regards the order of the paragraphs, Aubrey's
text has been given, where convenient, sentence by sentence,
and page by page. But I have taken full liberty to
bring into their proper place <i>marginalia</i>, interlinear notes,
<i>addenda</i> on opposite pages, &amp;c. In some cases, indeed, to
give in print the MS. text sentence by sentence is to do it
injustice. In the MS., the difference of inks between
earlier and later notes, the difference of pen-strokes (on one
day with a firm pen, on another with a scratchy quill), and
similar nuances, impress the eye with a sequence of paragraphs
which in print can be shown only by redistribution.
For example, I claim that the life of Milton, in this edition,
is, from its bolder treatment, truer to the MS., than the
servile version in the old edition.</p>

<p>4. As regards notes and explanations. Aubrey's lives
supply an inviting field for comment, correction, and
addition. But, even so treated, they will never be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
biographical dictionary. Their value lies not in statement
of bibliographical or other facts, but in their remarkably
vivid personal touches, in what Aubrey had seen himself
and what his friends had told him. The notes therefore
seek to supply no more than indications of outstanding
features of the text, identifications of Aubrey's informants,
or necessary parallels from his letters.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">IV. Description of the MSS.</span></h3>

<p><b>MS. Aubr. 6</b>: a volume chiefly of folio leaves; written
mostly in February 1679/80; now marked as containing 122
leaves (some pages blank), but having also a few unfoliated
slips. Aubrey's own short title to it was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'&#931;&#967;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#8049;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;. Brief Lives, part i.,'</p>

<p>and, in his pagination, it contained eighty-six leaves.
A rough index of its contents, by him, is found as foll. 8-10:
and there he gives the names of several persons whose lives
he intended to write, but has not included in this volume.
Some of these are found elsewhere, especially in MS.
Aubrey 8; but a few<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> are not discoverable in any MS. of his
biographical collections&mdash;e.g., Richard Alcorne; &lt;Samuel&gt;
Collins, D.D.; Richard Blackbourne, M.D.; &lt;John&gt;
Flamsted<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; Sir John Hoskins; James Rex; James, duke
of Monmouth<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; Peter Ramus; Benjamin Ruddier; captain
&lt;Edward&gt; Sherburne; captaine Thomas Stump<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; Richard
White. Possibly Aubrey never wrote the missing lives; but
it must be remembered (1) that he cut some leaves out
of his MS. himself (see in a note to the life of Richard
Boyle, earl of Cork); (2) that Anthony Wood cut out of
MS. Aubr. 7 forty pages at least, containing matters 'to
cut Aubrey's throat,' i.e. reflections on politics, where the
lives of James R. and Monmouth may well have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>One point about this MS. which deserves mention is
that, in these lives, Aubrey, in his hope to supply data for
crucial instances in astrology, is careful to give the exact
nativity wherever he can. His rule is thus laid down by
himself in MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 12<sup>v</sup>, in a note attached to the
nativity of his friend Sir William Petty:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'Italian proverb&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"E astrologia, ma non &eacute; Astrologo,"</p>

<p>i.e. we have not that science yet perfect; 'tis one
of the <i>desiderata</i>. The way to make it perfect is to gett
a supellex of true genitures; in order wherunto I have with
much care collected these ensuing<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, which the astrologers
may rely on, for I have sett doune none on randome, or doubtfull,
information, but <i>from their owne mouthes</i>: quod N. B.'</p>

<p>Another point is, that Aubrey very frequently gives the
coat of arms, in trick or colour. In some cases, no doubt,
he did this from having seen the arms actually borne in
some way by the person he is writing about; but in other
cases he merely looked up the name in a 'Dictionary of
Arms,' and took the coat from thence, thus nullifying his
testimony as to the actual pretensions to arms of those he
writes about. All coats he mentions have, however, been
given in the text or notes.</p>

<p>Prefixed to the volume<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> are two notes in which Aubrey
explains its origin and destination.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">'To my worthy friend Mr. ANTHONIE &agrave; WOOD,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">Antiquarie of Oxford.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Sir!</span><br />
</p>

<p>I have, according to your desire, putt in writing
these minutes of lives tumultuarily, as they occurr'd to my
thoughts or as occasionally I had information of them.
They may easily be reduced into order at your leisure by
numbring them with red figures, according to time and
place, &amp;c. 'Tis a taske that I never thought to have
undertaken till you imposed it upon me, sayeing that I was
fitt for it by reason of my generall acquaintance, having
now not only lived above halfe a centurie of yeares in the
world, but have also been much tumbled up and downe
in it which hath made me much<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> knowne; besides the
moderne advantage of coffee-howses in this great citie,
before which men knew not how to be acquainted, but
with their owne relations, or societies. I might add that
I come of a longaevous race, by which meanes I have
imped some feathers of the wings of time, for severall
generations; which does reach high. When I first began,
I did not thinke I could have drawne it out to so long
a thread.</p>

<p>I here lay-downe to you (out of the conjunct friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ship<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
between us) the trueth, and, as neer as I can and that
religiously as a poenitent to his confessor, nothing but the
trueth: the naked and plaine trueth, which is here exposed
so bare that the very <i>pudenda</i> are not covered<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and affords
many passages that would raise a blush in a young
virgin's<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> cheeke. So that after your perusall, I must
desire you to make a castration (as Raderus<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> to Martial)
and to sowe-on some figge-leaves&mdash;i.e., to be my <i>Index
expurgatorius</i>.</p>

<p>What uncertainty doe we find in printed histories?
they either treading too neer on the heeles of trueth
that they dare not speake plaine, or els for want of intelligence
(things being antiquated) become too obscure and
darke! I doe not here repeat any thing already published
(to the best of my remembrance) and I fancy my selfe
all along discourseing with you; alledgeing those of my
relations and acquaintance (as either you knew or have
heerd of) <i>ad faciendam fidem</i>: so that you make me to
renew my acquaintance with my old and deceased friends,
and to <i>rejuvenescere</i> (as it were) which is the pleasure of old
men. 'Tis pitty that such minutes had not been taken
100 yeares since or more: for want wherof many worthy
men's names and notions<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> are swallowd-up in oblivion;
as much of these also would [have<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> been], had it not been
through your instigation: and perhaps this is one of the
usefullest pieces<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that I have scribbeld.</p>

<p>I remember one sayeing of generall Lambert's, that "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>best of men are but men at the best": of this, you will
meet with divers examples in this rude and hastie collection.
Now these <i>arcana</i> are not fitt to lett flie abroad, till
about 30 yeares hence; for the author and the persons
(like medlars) ought to be first rotten. But in whose hands
must they be deposited in the mean time? advise me,
who am,</p>

<p><b>MS. Aubr. 7</b>: a folio volume of twenty-one leaves
(several pages blank), of which two<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> only belong to the
original MS.</p>

<p>The original title may be conjectured to have been:</p>

<p class="center">'&#931;&#967;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#8049;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;. Brief Lives, part ii.,'</p>

<p>and it possibly contained some letters, like those in the
preceding volume, which made Wood think it was given
to him.</p>

<p>On fol. 1, is a note describing the make-up of the
volume:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Aubrey's Lives: fragments of part ii.&mdash;These scattered
fragments collected and arranged by E. M. Sep. 1792.'
A note (in Dr. Philip Bliss's hand?) says that E. M. is
Edmund Malone.</p>

<p>In this, as in the other Aubrey MSS., Dr. Bliss has
made several slight notes, both in pencil and ink, with
a view to his edition.</p>

<p>The mutilation of the MS. was the crime of Anthony
Wood, to whom it had been sent. Two conjectures may
be hazarded&mdash;either that Wood did this in order to paste
the cuttings into his rough copy of his projected <i>Athenae</i>,
and so save transcription; or, more probably, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
so thoroughly alarmed by the threat of Lord Clarendon's
prosecution of himself (Clark's Wood's <i>Life and Times</i>, iv.
1-46), that he destroyed the papers containing Aubrey's
sharp reflections on various prominent personages<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. But
whatever the pretext, Aubrey was, naturally, very grieved
at his unjustifiable conduct. In a letter to Wood, dated
Sept. 2, 1694 (MS. Ballard 14, fol. 155), he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You have cutt out a matter of 40 pages out of one of
my volumnes, as also the index. Was ever any body so
unkind?&mdash;And I remember you told me comeing from
Hedington that there were some things in it that "would
cutt my throat." I thought you so deare a friend that
I might have entrusted my life in your hands and now
your unkindnes doth almost break my heart.'</p>

<p>When Aubrey had the volume back in his own hands,
he wrote in it<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the following censure:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ingratitude! This <i>part the second</i> Mr. Wood haz
gelded from page <a href="#Page_1">1</a> to page <a href="#Page_44">44</a> and other pages<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> too are
wanting wherein are contained trueths, but such as I
entrusted nobody with the sight of but himselfe (whom
I thought I might have entrusted with my life). There
are severall papers that may cutt my throate. I find too
late <i>Memento diffidere</i> was a saying worthy one of the
sages. He hath also embezill'd the index of it&mdash;quod N. B.
It was stitch't up when I sent it to him.</p>

four leaves at the beginning (for an index<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>), and leaves
foliated 1-38 (of which 12 and 13 are now<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> missing).</p>

<p>Aubrey, on fol. 69, writes the title:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'An Apparatus for the lives<br />
of our English mathematical writers<br />
by<br />
Mr. John Aubrey, R.S.S.<br />
March 25, 1690.'</p>

<p>As originally made up, this treatise consisted of one leaf (for
an index<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>) and pages marked <a href="#Page_1">1</a>-46 (of which pp. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>-38
are now missing).</p>

<p>The history of this treatise is fully set out by Aubrey in
some notes in it and in the other MSS.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It was suggested by Richard Blackburne.</p>

<p>MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 8<sup>v</sup>:&mdash;'Dr. &lt;Richard&gt; Blackbourn
would have me putt out in print the lives of our English
mathematicians together.'</p>

<p>2. It had been partly anticipated by Selden and
Sherburne.</p>

<p>MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 70:&mdash;'My purpose is, if God give me
life, to make an <i>apparatus</i>, for<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the lives of our English
Mathematicians; which when I have ended, I would then

mathematicians from the lives already written by Aubrey.</p>

<p>The reason for this title was that Aubrey intended his
Collections to be a sort of commentary on Hobbes' short
Latin autobiography, which was in the press in Febr. 1679/80,
and was published in Nov. 1680 (Clark's Wood's <i>Life and
Times</i>, ii. 480, 500).</p>

<p>But Anthony Wood (MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 28) objected:&mdash;'What
need you say Supplimentum?' <i>sic</i> 'pray say the
life of Thomas Hobbs.' And Aubrey, in obedience to this,
changed the short title on fol. 30 (see the beginning of the
life); and on the parchment cover of the MS. (now fol. 1)
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'The life of<br />
Mr. Thomas Hobbes,<br />
of Malmsbury,<br />
by<br />
Mr. John Aubrey,<br />
Fellow of the Royall Societie,<br />
1679/80.'</p>

<p>Aubrey set about this Life of Hobbes immediately
after Hobbes' death, partly as a tribute of respect to his
friend's memory, but apparently also in fulfilment of
a promise to the deceased. The preface<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">Lectori.</span></p>

I here<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> dischardge, with my promise (1667) to my old
friend Mr. T&lt;homas&gt; H&lt;obbes&gt;, in publishing<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> his life
and performing the last office to my old<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> friend
Mr. Thomas Hobbes, whom I have had the honour to
know &lt;from&gt; my child-hood<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, being his countreyman and
borne in Malmesbury hundred and taught my grammar
by his schoolmaster<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>Since nobody knew so many particulars of his life as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>myselfe, he was willing<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that if I survived him, it should
be handed to posterity by my hands, which I declare and

<p>I have hastily writt this third draught, which
I hope is legible: I have not time to read it over.
Pray peruse it as soon as you can, for time drawes on.
Dr. Blackburne and I will be diligent in it and will doe
<i>you</i> all the right<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> your heart can wish. I thought together
with this to have sent you the transcript of Mr. Hobbes'
life revised by himselfe but am prevented by hast, and 'tis
the last day of the terme. I will send it suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Why might not his two sheetes <i>Of heresie</i> be bound up
with this to preserve it and propagate trueth?</p>

<p>I know here be severall tautologies; but I putt them
downe thus here, that upon reviewe I should judge where
such or such a thing would most aptly stand.</p>

<p>Why should not Dr. Blackbourne in the life of Mr. H.
written by him selfe quote that of A. Wood in the margent
for a blindation, because there are in great part the very
same words?'</p>

<p>Shall I in the first place putt Mr. H. life donne by
himselfe? (If so, whether in Latin, or English, or both?)
Or else, shall I intersperse it with these animadversions?</p>

<p>I could begin with a pleasant description of Malmesbury,

will lead me to, and which Ant. Wood seemes to desire.</p>

<p><b>Other MSS.</b> A few additional lives, and portions of lives,
of persons mentioned in these four biographical volumes,
have been brought in from letters by Aubrey in MS.
Ballard 14 and in MS. Wood F 39 and F 49.</p>

<p>Three lives, in fair copy, by Aubrey, are found in MS.
Rawlinson D. 727, foll. 93-96, and have been given here.
They were formerly in Anthony Wood's hands: see
Clark's Wood's <i>Life and Times</i>, iv. 192, note.</p>

<p>MS. Aubr. 21, a volume made up in the Ashmolean
library from siftings out of Aubrey MSS. and papers; MS.
Aubr. 22, a collection of grammatical tracts, brought
together by Aubrey with a view to a treatise on education;
MS. Aubr. 23, a volume of 125 leaves, dated on fol. 8 as
'Collectio geniturarum, made London May 29, 1674,' but
on the title as '1677: for the &lt;Ashmolean&gt; Musaeum';
MS. Aubr. 26,'Faber fortunae,' i.e. projects for retrieving
Aubrey's fortunes&mdash;&mdash;have yielded additional matter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">V. The Old Edition.</span></h3>

<p>The pith of these lives was extracted by Anthony Wood,
and incorporated in his <i>Athenae</i>, vol. i. in 1691, vol. ii. in
1692, and the 'appendix' left in MS. at his death
(published in the second edition of the <i>Athenae</i> in 1721).</p>

<p>The MSS. of Aubrey's 'Lives' were placed in the library
of the Ashmolean Museum, in the personal custody of the
Keeper, Edward Lhwyd, in 1693. Aubrey, writing<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> to
Thomas Tanner, intimates that his MSS. will show how
greatly Wood's <i>Athenae</i> was indebted to his help, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>makes a special request that Wood shall not know that
they have been placed in the Museum.</p>

<p>Beginning<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> on Sept. 16, 1792, Edmund Malone made
a transcript of 174 lives from the three MSS. (MS. Aubr.
6, 7, 8), with notes, with a view to publication. The first
volume of this contained folios 1-152, forty-four lives of
poets and sixty-eight of prose writers. It is now in the
Bodleian, by the gift of C. E. Doble, Esq.; but mutilated,
folios 126-152 having been torn off from the end of the
volume. The second volume, containing folios 153-385,
sixty-two lives, was MS. 9405 in Sir Thomas Phillipps'
library, was mentioned in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (8 S. vii.
375), and has recently been bought by the Bodleian.</p>

<p>Some years later, James Caulfield, of London, publisher,
arranged for the issue of a select number of biographies
from Aubrey's MSS., illustrated by engravings from
originals in the Ashmolean and elsewhere. They were
to appear under the title of 'The Oxford Cabinet'; and
one part, 32 pp., a very pretty book, was published at
London in 1797. This part contains the lives of William
Aubrey, Francis Bacon, John Barclay, and Francis Beaumont,
with engravings (inter alia) of Aubrey's drawings
of Verulam House, and Bacon's fishponds. At this point
the Keeper of the Ashmolean, at Malone's instance, withdrew
the permission which had been granted to Curtis
to transcribe for Caulfield. The reason given was that
Curtis had taken away papers and title-pages from Oxford
libraries, and was not to be trusted in the Ashmolean&mdash;see
Macray's <i>Annals of the Bodleian</i>, p. 273.</p>

<p>The dates, however, suggest that Malone's action may
have been in part inspired by a wish to keep the course
clear for his own project. The transcription made for
Caulfield, although not always accurate in point of spelling,
is by no means badly done: certainly it is much better
than that which was made for the later issue.</p>

<p>In 1813 appeared '<i>Letters written by Eminent Persons ...
and Lives of Eminent Men by John Aubrey, Esq. ...</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
from the originals in the Bodleian Library and Ashmolean
Museum: in two volumes.' The editors are said to
have been Dr. Philip Bliss and the Rev. John Walker,
Fellow of New College.</p>

<p>The <i>Lives</i> by Aubrey occupy pp. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>-637 of Volume II.</p>

<p>Dr. Bliss's interests were bibliographical, and he was not
careful<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> to collate with original MSS. either the printed
text of earlier editions or transcripts made for himself.
As a result, that issue of Aubrey's Lives, although making
accessible the greater portion of what is interesting in
the originals, is marred by many grave blunders and
arbitrary omissions.</p>

<p>A comparison of a few pages of Dr. Bliss's edition with
Aubrey's MS. copy suggests a troublesome question in
English textual criticism. If two eminent Oxford scholars
in the beginning of the nineteenth century could thus
pervert their author's meaning, can we have trust in the
earlier redaction of greater texts, such as Shakespeare?</p>

<p>He sayes that Mr. Allen was a very cheerfull, facetious

howse on their <i>Gaudie-dayes</i> were wont to invite him.</p>

<p>His picture was drawne at the request of Dr. Ralph
Kettle, and hangs in the dining roome of the President of
Trin. Coll. Oxon. (of which house he first was, and had
his education there) by which it appeares that he was
a handsome sanguine man, and of an excellent habit
of bodie.</p>

<p>There is mention of him in <i>Leicester's Commonwealth</i><a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
that the great Dudley, earle of Leicester, made use of
him for casting nativities, for he was the best astrologer
of his time. He hath written a large and learned commentary,
in folio, on the Quadripartite of Ptolemie, which
Elias Ashmole hath in MS. fairly written, and I hope will
one day be printed.</p>

<p>In those darke times astrologer, mathematician, and
conjurer, were accounted the same things; and the vulgar
did verily beleeve him to be a conjurer. He had a great
many mathematicall instruments and glasses in his
chamber, which did also confirme the ignorant in their
opinion, and his servitor (to impose on freshmen and
simple people) would tell them that sometimes he should
meet the spirits comeing up his staires like bees.
One<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[V.]</a> of our parish<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[VI.]</a> was of Glocester Hall about
70 yeares and more since, and told me this

lechery in lying, and imposing on the understandings of
beleeving people, and he thought it for his credit to serve
such a master.</p>

<p>He was generally acquainted, and every long vacation,
he rode into the countrey to visitt his old acquaintance
and patrones, to whom his great learning, mixt with much
sweetnes of humour, rendred him very welcome. One
time being at Hom Lacy<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in Herefordshire, at Mr. John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Scudamore's (grandfather to the lord Scudamor), he
happened to leave<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> his watch in the chamber windowe&mdash;(watches
were then rarities)&mdash;The maydes came in to
make the bed, and hearing a thing in a case cry <i>Tick,
Tick, Tick</i>, presently concluded that that was his Devill,
and tooke it by the string with the tongues<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, and threw it
out of the windowe into the mote (to<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> drowne the Devill.)
It so happened that the string hung on a sprig of an elder
that grew out of the mote, and this confirmed them that
'twas the Devill. So the good old gentleman gott his
watch again.</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby loved him much (vide Sir K. Digby's
Life &lt;p.&gt; 69<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>), and bought his excellent library of him,
which he gave to the University. I have a Stifelius'
Arithmetique that was his, which I find he had much
perused, and no doubt mastered. He was interred in
Trinity College Chapell, (quaere where: as I take it,
the outer Chapell.) George Bathurst<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> B.D. made his

<p>Queen Elizabeth sent for him to have his advice about
the new star that appeared in the Swan or Cassiopeia (but
I think the Swan), to which he gave his judgment very
learnedly.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>Lancelot Andrewes<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>, lord bishop of Winton, was
borne in London; went to schoole at Merchant Taylors
schoole. Mr. Mulcaster<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> was his schoolemaster, whose
picture he hung in his studie (as Mr. Thomas Fuller,
<i>Holy State</i>).</p>

<p>Old Mr. Sutton, a very learned man of those dayes,
of Blandford St. Maries, Dorset, was his school fellowe,
and sayd that Lancelot Andrewes was a great long boy
of 18 yeares old at least before he went to the university.</p>

<p>He was a fellowe<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of Pembroke-hall, in Cambridge
(called <i>Collegium Episcoporum</i>, for that, at one time, in
those dayes, there were of that house ... bishops).</p>

<p>The Puritan faction did begin to increase in those dayes,
and especially at Emanuel College. That party had
a great mind to drawe in this learned young man, whom
if they could make theirs, they knew would be a great
honour to them. They carried themselves outwardly with
great sanctity and strictnesse, so that 'twas very hard matter
to&mdash;&mdash;as to their lives. They preached up very strict
keeping and observing the Lord's day; made, upon the
matter, damnation to breake it, and that 'twas lesse sin
to kill a man then.... Yet these hypocrites did bowle
in a private green at their colledge every Sunday after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>sermon; and one of the colledge (a loving friend to
Mr. L. Andrewes) to satisfie him one time lent him the
key of a private back dore to the bowling green, on
a Sunday evening, which he opening, discovered these
zealous preachers, with their gownes off, earnest at play.
But they were strangely surprized to see the entrey of
one that was not of <i>the brotherhood</i>.</p>

<p>There was then at Cambridge a good fatt alderman
that was wont to sleep at church, which the alderman
endeavoured to prevent but could not. Well! this was
preached against as a signe of <i>reprobation</i>. The good
man was exceedingly troubled at it, and went to Andrewes
his chamber to be satisfied in point of conscience.
Mr. Andrewes told him that &lt;it&gt; was an ill habit of body
not of mind, and that it was against his will; advised him
on Sundays to make a more sparing meale and to mend
it at supper. The alderman did so, but sleepe comes
upon &lt;him&gt; again for all that, and was preached at.
&lt;He&gt; comes againe to be resolved, with tears in his eies;
Andrewes then told him he would have him make a good
heartie meale as he was wont to doe, and presently take
out his full sleep. He did so<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>; came to St. Marie's<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>,
where the preacher was prepared with a sermon to damne
all who slept at sermon, a certaine signe of <i>reprobation</i>.
The good alderman having taken his full nap before,
lookes on the preacher all sermon time, and spoyled the
designe.&mdash;But I should have sayd that Andrewes was
most extremely spoken against and preached against for
offering to assoile or excuse a sleeper in sermon time.
But he had learning and witt enough to<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> defend himselfe.</p>

<p>His great learning quickly made him known in the
university, and also to King James, who much valued
him for it, and advanced him, and at last<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> made him
bishop of Winchester, which bishoprick he ordered with
great prudence as to government of the parsons, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ferring
of ingeniose persons that were staked to poore
livings and did <i>delitescere</i>. He made it his enquiry to
find out such men. Amongst severall others (whose names
have escaped my memorie) Nicholas Fuller (he wrote
<i>Critica Sacra</i>), minister of Allington neer Amesbury
in Wilts, was one. The bishop sent for him, and the
poor man was afrayd and knew not what hurt he had
donne. &lt;He&gt; makes him sitt downe to dinner; and,
after the desert, was brought in in a dish his institution
and induction, or the donation, of a prebend: which was
his way. He chose out alwayes able men to his chaplaines,
whom he advanced. Among others, &lt;Christopher&gt; Wren,
of St. John's in Oxon, was his chaplaine, a good generall
scholar and good orator, afterwards deane of Winsore,
from whom (by his son in lawe, Dr. William Holder)
I have taken this exact account of that excellent prelate.</p>

<p>His Life is before his Sermons, and also his epitaph,
which see. He dyed at Winchester house, in Southwark,
and lies buried in a chapell at St. Mary Overies, where
his executors ... Salmon M. D. and Mr. John Saintlowe,
merchant of London, have erected (but I beleeve
according to his lordship's will, els they would not have
layed out 1000 <i>li.</i>) a sumptuose monument for him.</p>

<p>He had not that smooth way of oratory as now. It
was a shrewd and severe animadversion of a Scotish lord,
who, when king James asked him how he liked bp. A.'s
sermon, sayd that he was learned, but he did play with
his text, as a Jack-an-apes does, who takes up a thing and
tosses and playes with it, and then he takes up another,
and playes a little with it. Here's a pretty thing, and
there's a pretty thing!</p>

<p>In Aprill I fell sick of the small pox at Trinity College;
and when I recovered, after Trinity weeke<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, my father
sent for me into the country again: where I conversed<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
with none but servants and rustiques and soldiers quartred,
to my great griefe (<i>Odi prophanum vulgus et arceo</i>), for in
those dayes fathers were not acquainted with their children.
It was a most sad life to me, then in the prime of my
youth, not to have the benefitt of an ingeniose conversation
and scarce any good bookes&mdash;almost a consumption. This
sad life I did lead in the country till 1646, at which time
I gott (with much adoe) leave of my father to lett me goe
to the Middle Temple, April the 6<sup>th</sup> 1646; admitted....</p>

<p>24 June following, Oxon was surrendred, and then came
to London many of the king's party, with whom I<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> grew
acquainted (many of them I knew before). I loved not
debauches<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, but their martiall conversation was not so fitt
for the muses.</p>

<p>Novemb. 6, I returned to Trinity College in Oxon
again to my great joy; was much made of by the fellowes;
had their learned conversation, lookt on bookes, musique.
Here and at Middle Temple (off and on) I (for the most
part) enjoyd the greatest felicity of my life (ingeniose
youths, as<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> rosebudds, imbibe the morning dew<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>) till
Dec. 1648 (Christmas Eve's eve) I was sent for from
Oxon home again to my sick father, who never recovered.

<p><a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>Memorandum. J. Aubrey in the yeare 1666, wayting
then upon Joane Sumner to her brother at Seen in Wilts,
there made a discovery of a chalybiate waters and those
more impregnated than any waters yet heard of in
England. I sent some bottles to the Royal Society in
June 1667, which were tryed with galles before a great
assembly there. It turnes so black that you may write
legibly with it, and did there, after so long a carriage,
turne as deepe as a deepe claret. The physitians were
wonderfully surprized at it, and spake to me to recommend
it to the doctors of the Bath (from whence it is but about
10 miles) for that in some cases 'tis best to begin with
such waters and end with the Bath, and in some <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.
I wrote severall times, but to no purpose, for at last I found
that, though they were satisfied of the excellency of the
waters and what the London doctors sayd was true, they
did not care to have company goe from the Bath. So
I inserted it last yeare in Mr. Lilly's almanac, and towards
the later end of summer there came so much company
that the village could not containe them, and they are now
preparing for building of houses against the next summer.
Jo&lt;hn&gt; Sumner sayth (whose well is the best) that it will
be worth to him 200 <i>li.</i> per annum. Dr. &lt;Nehemiah&gt;
Grew in his History of the Repository of the Royal Society
mentions this discovery, as also of the iron oare there not
taken notice of before&mdash;&mdash;'tis in part iii, cap. 2, pag. 331.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>Then lawe-suite with her<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. Then sold Easton-Peirse<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>,
and the farme at Broad Chalke. Lost 500 <i>li.</i>
(Fr. H.) + 200 <i>li.</i> + goods + timber. Absconded as a
banishd man.</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p class="center">In monte Dei videbitur<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>I was in as much affliction as a mortall could bee, and
never quiet till all was gone, &lt;and I&gt; wholly<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> cast myselfe

<p>Monastery<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>I wished monastrys had not been putt downe, that the
reformers would have been more moderate as to that
point. Nay, the Turkes have monasteries. Why should
our reformers be so severe? Convenience of religious
houses&mdash;Sir Christopher Wren&mdash;fitt there should be receptacles
and provision for contemplative men; if of 500,
but one or two<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. 'Tis compensated<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. What a pleasure
'twould have been to have travelled from monastery to
monastery. The reformers in the Lutheran countrys were
more prudent then to destroy them (e.g. in Holsatia, etc.);
&lt;they&gt; only altered the religion.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all these embarasments I did <i>pian
piano</i> (as they occur'd) take<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> notes of antiquity; and
having a quick draught, have drawne landskips on horseback
symbolically, e.g. &lt;on my&gt; journey to Ireland in
July, Anno Domini 166-.</p>

<p>&lt;The&gt; earl of Thanet<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> &lt;gave me&gt; <i>otium</i> at Hethefield.</p>

<p>Borne at Easton-Piers, March 12, 1625/6, about sun-rising:
very weake and like to dye, and therfore Christned that
morning before Prayer. I thinke I have heard my mother
say I had an ague shortly after I was borne.</p>

<p>1629: about 3 or 4 yeares old, I had a grievous ague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>I can remember it. I gott not health till 11, or 12: but
had sicknesse of vomiting for 12 howres every fortnight for ...
yeares; then, it came monethly for ...; then,
quarterly; and then, halfe-yearly; the last was in June
1642. This sicknesse nipt my strength in the bud.</p>

<p>1633: 8 yeares old, I had an issue (naturall) in the
coronall suture of my head, which continued running
till 21.</p>

<p>1634: October<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>: I had a violent fever that was like to
have carried me off. 'Twas the most dangerous sicknesse
that ever I had.</p>

<p>About 1639 (or 1640) I had the measills, but that was
nothing: I was hardly sick.</p>

<p>1639: Monday after Easter weeke my uncle's nag ranne
away with me, and gave a very dangerous fall.</p>

<p>1642: May 3, entred at Trinity College, Oxon.</p>

<p>1643: April and May, the small-pox at Oxon; and
shortly after, left that ingeniouse place; and for three
yeares led a sad life in the countrey.</p>

<p>1646: April &mdash;&mdash;, admitted of the Middle Temple. But
my father's sicknesse, and businesse, never permitted me
to make any settlement to my studie.</p>

<p>1651: about the 16 or 18 of April, I sawe that incomparable
good conditioned gentlewoman, Mris M. Wiseman,
with whom at first sight I was in love&mdash;haeret lateri<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.</p>

<p>1652: October 21: my father died.</p>

<p>1655: (I thinke) June 14, I had a fall at Epsam, and
brake one of my ribbes and was afrayd it might cause an
apostumation.</p>

<p>1656: September 1655, or rather (I thinke) 1656, I
began my chargeable and taedious lawe-suite about the
entaile in Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire.</p>

<p>This yeare, and the last, was a strange year to me, and<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>

<p>1659: March or Aprill, like to breake my neck in Ely
minster, and the next day, riding a gallop there, my horse
tumbled over and over, and yet (I thanke God) no hurt.</p>

<p>1660: July, August, I accompanied A. Ettrick into
Ireland for a moneth; and returning were like to be ship-wrackt
at Holy-head, but no hurt donne.</p>

<p>1661, 1662, 1663: about these yeares I sold my estate
in Herefordshire.</p>

<p>...<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>: Janu., had the honour to be elected fellow of the
Royal Society.</p>

<p>1664: June 11, landed at Calais. In August following,
had a terrible fit of the spleen, and piles, at Orleans. I
returned in October.</p>

<p>1664, or 1665: Munday after Christmas, was in danger
to be spoiled by my horse, and the same day received
laesio in testiculo which was like to have been fatall.
Quaere R. Wiseman quando&mdash;I beleeve 1664.</p>

<p>1665: November 1; I made my first addresse (in an ill
howre) to Joane Sumner.</p>

<p>1666: this yeare all my businesses and affaires ran
kim kam. Nothing tooke effect, as if I had been under
an ill tongue. Treacheries and enmities in abundance
against me.</p>

<p>1667: December &mdash;: arrested in Chancery lane, at Mrs.
Sumner's suite.</p>

<p>&lt;1667/8&gt;: Febr. 24, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> about 8 or 9, triall with her at
Sarum. Victory and 600 <i>li.</i> dammage, though divelish
opposition against me.</p>

<p>1668: July 6, was arrested by Peter Gale's malicious
contrivance, the day before I was to goe to Winton for my
second triall, but it did not retain me above two howres;
but did not then goe to triall.</p>

<p>1669<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>: March 5, was my triall at Winton, from 8 to 9,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> This beginning of Aubrey's autobiography is explained by Henry Coley's
judgment on his nativity, found in MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 104, on the scheme 'J. A.
natus 1625/6, March 11th, 17<sup>h</sup> 14&acute; 44&#733; <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, sub latitudine 51&deg; 30&acute;.'
</p>
<p>
'The nativity,' Coley says, 'is a most remarkable opposition, and 'tis much
pitty the starres were not more favourable to the native.' Coley goes on to
state that the stars 'threaten ruin to land and estate; give superlative vexations
in matters relating to marriag, and wondrous contests in law-suits&mdash;of all which
vexations I suppose the native hath had a greater portion than ever was desired.'
Aubrey must have been only too glad to have authority for attributing his
failure in life to the stars, and not to his own ill-conduct.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> In MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 3, in jottings at the side of his horoscope, Aubrey
suggests that his failure in this respect was due to defects of his upbringing, not
of natural ability.

Aubr. 23, fol. 105<sup>v</sup>, finds that the stars show that he 'will be in great danger
between the years of 40 and 50.'&mdash;On this Aubrey remarks:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Much about that time the native was several times in danger of expiration,
as,
</p>
<p>
first, by the e&lt;arl&gt; of P&lt;embroke&gt;;
</p>
<p>
2, a bruise of the left side;
</p>
<p>
3, a narrow escape of falling downe stayres; and,

<p>
lastly, as dangerous a fall from a horse;
</p>
<p>
besides the accident of sowneing, cum multis aliis.

by an arrest, and other untoward transactions.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> In MS. Aubr. 23 (his 'Collectio geniturarum'), fol. 116, 117, are letters
from Charles Snell about Aubrey's nativity and accidents. Snell there
enumerates Aubrey's:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Sicknesse att birth; ague and vomittings aboute 5 or 6 yeares old; issue in
his head; small-pox; amours with madam Wiseman<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>; selling away the
mannor of Stratford, etc.; haesitating in his speech.'
</p>
<p>
Snell gives this advice:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'If the haesitation in your speech doth hinder, gett a parsonage of 4 or 500 <i>li.</i>
per annum, and give a curat 100 <i>li.</i> per annum to officiate for you.'
</p>
<p>
The letter is dated from 'Fordingbridge; 12 August, 1676.'
</p>
<p>
Aubrey, in his letters to Anthony Wood, several times touches on the idea
of his taking Orders. MS. Ballard 14, fol. 98:&mdash;'I am like to be spirited away
to Jamaica by my lord &lt;John&gt; Vaughan, who is newly made governor there,
and mighty earnest to have me goe with him and will looke out some employment
worthy a gentleman for me. Fough! the cassock stinkes: it would
be ridiculous.'&mdash;April 9, 1674. MS. Ballard 14, fol. 119:&mdash;'I am stormed by
my chiefest friends afresh, viz. Baron Bertie<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, Sir William Petty, Sir John
Hoskyns, bishop of Sarum<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, etc., to turne ecclesiastique; "but the king of
France growes stronger and stronger, and what if the Roman religion should
come-in againe?" "Why then!" say they, "<i>cannot you turne too?</i>" You,
I say, know well that I am no puritan, nor an enimy to the old gentleman
on the other side of the Alpes. Truly, if I had a good parsonage of
2 or 300 <i>li.</i> per annum, (as you told me) it would be a shrewd temptation.'&mdash;Aug.
29, 1676.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> Aubrey notes in the margin, (1) 'T. H.' (in a monogram), i.e. that this
Latimer had been schoolmaster to Thomas Hobbes, and (2), 'delicate little
horse,' to indicate that he did not walk the mile to Leigh-de-la-mere like a poor
boy, but rode his pony there like a fine gentleman. John Britton has mis-read
the note, and made it a description of Mr. Latimer's appearance, 'delicate little
<i>person</i>.'
</p>
<p>
In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 109, Aubrey gives this inscription as on a stone 'under
the communion-table' in the church of Leigh-de-la-mere:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Here lieth Mr. Robert Latymer, sometime rector and pastor of this church,
who deceased this life the second day of November, anno domini 1634.'</p></div>
<p>
And then Aubrey notes:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'This Mr. Latimer was schoolmaster at Malmsbury<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> to Mr. Thomas Hobbes.
He afterwards taught children here<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. He entred me into my accedence.
Before Mr. Latimer, one Mr. Taverner was rector here, who was the parson
that maried my grand-father and grandmother Lyte.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> In a marginal note (MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 3), Aubrey excuses his father's
neglect of his education on the plea that he himself grew up illiterate. The
note is:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'My grandfather A&lt;ubrey&gt; dyed, leaving my father, who was not educated
to learning, but to hawking.' See in the life of Alderman John Whitson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> In the margin Aubrey notes:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'&#9796;: strong impulse to &#9796;.' This means I suppose that the position of Saturn
at his nativity gave him a bias to the study of antiquities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> This means, I suppose, that the copies he made sufficiently resembled the
pictures on the parlour wall. A note in MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 6<sup>v</sup>, perhaps refers to
his own skill in drawing, 'As Mr. Walter Waller's picture drawne after his
death; &egrave; contra, I have done severall by the life.' Walter Waller was vicar of
Chalk, where Aubrey lived: see in the life of Edmund Waller.</p></div>

a MS.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> of funeralls, and other good notes, in the hands
of Sir Henry St. George, ...<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, marked thus &#9825;. I guesse
it to be the hand-writing of Sir Daniel Dun, knight, LL.
Dr., who maried Joane, third daughter of Dr. William
Aubrey:&mdash;</p>

<p>William Aubrey (the second son of Thomas Aubrey,
the 4th son of Hopkin Aubrey, of Abercunvrig in the
countie of Brecon, esqre) in the 66th yeare of his age or
thereabouts, and on the 25th of June, in the yeare of
our Lord 1595, departed this life, and was buried in the
Cathedrall-church of St. Paul in London, on the north
side of the chancell, over against the tombe of Sir John
Mason, knight, at the base or foot of a great pillar
standing upon the highest step of certain degrees or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>staires rising into the quire eastward from the same
pillar towards the tombe of the right honble the lord
William, earle of Pembroke, and his funeralls were performed
the 23d of July, 1595. This gentleman in his
tender yeares learned the first grounds of grammar in
the College of Brecon, in Brecknock towne, and from
thence about his age of fourteen yeares he was sent by
his parents to the University of Oxford, where, under the
tuition and instruction of one Mr. Morgan, a great learned
man, in a few yeares he so much profited in humanity
and other recommendable knowledge, especially in
Rhetorique and Histories, as that he was found to be
fitt for the studie of the Civill Law, and thereupon was
also elected into the fellowship<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> of All-soules Colledge
in Oxford (where the same Lawe<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> hath alwayes much
flourished). In which Colledge he ernestly studied and
diligently applied himselfe to the lectures and exercise of
the house, as that he there attained the degree of a Doctor
of the Law Civill at his age of 25 yeares, and immediately
after, he had bestowed on him the Queen's Publique
Lecture of Law in the university, the which he read with
so great a commendation as that his fame for learning
and knowledge was spred far abroad and he also esteemed
worthy to be called to action in the commonwealth.
Wherefor, shortly after, he was made Judge
Marshall of the Queen's armies at St. Quintins in France.
Which warrs finished, he returned into England, and
determining with himselfe, in more peaceable manner
and according to his former education, to passe on the
course of his life in the exercise of law, he became an
advocate of the Arches, and so rested many yeares, but
with such fame and credit as well for his rare skill and
science in the<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> law, as also for his sound judgment and
good experience therein, as that, of men of best judgment,
he was generally accounted peerlesse in that facultie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherupon, as occasion fell out for imployment of a civilian,
his service was often used as well within the realme as in
forrein countries. In which imployments, he alwaies used
such care and diligence and good circumspection, as that
his valour and vertues dayly more appearing ministred
means to his further advancement. In soe much that he
was preferred to be one of the Councell of the Marches of
Wales, and shortly after placed Master of the Chancery,
and the appointed Judge of the Audience, and constituted
Vicar Generall to the Lord Archbishop of &lt;Canterbury&gt;
through the whole province, and last, by the especiall
grace of the queene's most excellent majestie, queen
Elizabeth, he was taken to her highnesse nearer service
and made one of the Masters of Request in ordinarie. All
which titles and offices (the Mastership of Chancery,
which seemed not competible with the office of Master of
Requestes, only excepted) he by her princely favour possessed
and enjoyed untill the time of his death. Besides
the great learning and wisdome that this gentleman was
plentifully endowed withall, Nature had also framed him
so courteous of disposition and affable of speech, so sweet
of conversation and amiable behaviour, that there was
never any in his place better beloved all his life, nor he
himselfe more especially favoured of her majestie and the
greatest personages in the realme in any part of his life
then he was when he drew nearest his death. He was of
stature not taull, nor yet over-low, not grosse in bodie,
and yet of good habit; somewhat inclining to fatnesse of
visage in his youth; round, well favoured, well coloured
and lovely; and albeit in his latter yeares sicknesse had
much<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> impaired his strength and the freshnesse of his hew,
yet there remained there still to the last in his countenance
such comely and decent gravity, as that the change rather
added unto them then ought diminished his former dignitie.
He left behind him when he died, by a vertuouse gentlewoman
Wilgiford his wife (the first daughter of Mr. John
Williams of Tainton in the countie of Oxford, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
maried very young a maiden, and enjoyed to his death,
that both having lived together in great love and kindnesse
by the space of 40 yeares) three sons and six daughters,
all of them maried, and having issue, as

to Rachel, one of the daughters of Richard
Danvers of Tockenham, in com. Wilts, esqre.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he was one of the delegates (together
with Dr. Dale, &amp;c.) for the tryall of Mary, queen of Scots, and
was a great stickler for the saving of her life, which kindnesse
was remembred by King James att his comeing-in
to England, who asked after<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> him, and probably<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>have made him Lord Keeper, but he dyed, as appeares,
a little<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> before that good opportunity happened. His
majestie sent for his sonnes<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, and knighted the two eldest,
and invited them to court, which they modestly and
perhaps prudently, declined. They preferred a country
life.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;the <i>Penkenol</i>, i.e. chiefe of the family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>is my cosen Aubrey of Llannelly in Brecknockshire, of
about 60 or 80 <i>li.</i> per annum inheritance; and the Doctor
should have given a distinction; for want of which in a
badge on one of his servants' blew-coates, his cosen
William Aubrey<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, also LL. Dr., who was the chiefe,
plucked it off.</p>

<p>The learned John Dee was his great friend and kinsman,
as I find by letters between them in the custody of
Elias Ashmole, esqre, viz., John Dee wrote a booke <i>The
Soveraignty of the Sea</i>, dedicated to queen Elizabeth, which
was printed, in folio. Mr. Ashmole hath it, and also the
originall copie of John Dee's hand writing, and annexed
to it is a lettre of his cosen Dr. William Aubrey<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, whose
advise he desired in his writing on that subject.</p>

<p>He purchased Abercunvrig (the ancient seate of the
family) of his cosen Aubrey. He built the great house at
Brecknock, his studie lookes on the river Uske. He could
ride nine miles together in his owne land in Breconshire.
In Wales and England he left 2500 <i>li.</i> per annum wherof
there is now none left in the family. He made one Hugh
George (his chiefe clark) his executor, who ran away into
Ireland and cosened all the legatees, and among others my
grandfather (his youngest son) for the addition of whose
estate he had contracted with.... for Pembridge castle
in the com. of Hereford, which appeares by his will, and
for which his executor was to have payed. He made
a deed of entaile (36 Eliz., 15&lt;94&gt;) which is also mentioned
in his will, wherby he entailes the Brecon estate on the
issue male of his eldest son, and in defailer, to skip the
2d son (for whom he had well provided, and had maried
a great fortune) and to come to the third. Edward the
eldest had seaven sonnes; and his eldest son, Sir William,
had also seaven sonnes; and so I am heire, being the 18th
man in remainder, which putts me in mind of Dr. Donne,</p>

<p>Old Judge Sir &lt;Edward&gt; Atkins remembred Dr. A.
when he was a boy; he lay at his father's house in
Glocestershire: he kept his coach, which was rare in
those dayes. The Judge told me they then (vulgarly)
called it a <i>Quitch</i>. I have his originall picture. He had
a delicate, quick, lively and piercing black eie, fresh
complexion, and a severe eie browe. The figure in his
monument at St. Paules is not like him, it is too big.</p>

<p><i>Heroum filii noxae</i>: he engrossed all the witt of the
family, so that none descended from him can pretend to
any. 'Twas pitty that Dr. Fuller had not mentioned
him amongst his Worthys in that countie.</p>

<p>When he lay dyeing, he desired them to send for a
<i>goodman</i>; they thought he meant Dr. Goodman, deane
of St. Paules, but he meant a priest, as I have heard my
cosen John Madock say. Capt. Pugh was wont to say
that civilians (as most learned an&lt;d&gt; gent.) naturally
incline to the church of Rome; and the common lawyers,
as more ignorant and clownish, to the church of Geneva.</p>

capable of. Marie, our Brittishe, for the riches of the

advawntageable to utter any thinge by a skillfull artificer.
This navie which you aptlie, accordinge to the nature and
meaninge of your platt, call pettie, is so sette furthe by
you, thos principall and royall navies of the Grecianes and
Trojanes described by Homer and Vergill are no more
bownde to them, then it is to you.</p>

<p>You argue or rather thoondre so thicke and so strong
for the necessitie and commoditie of your navie, that you
leade or rather drawe me <i>obtorto collo</i> to be of opinion with
you, the benefitte therofe to be suche as it wilbe a brydle
and restreynte for conspiracies of foreyne nationes, and of
owre owne a salfegarde to merchants from infestationes
of pyrates; a readie meane to breed and augmente
noombers of skillfull marryners and sowldiers for the
sea, a mayntynawnce in proces of tyme for multitudes
of woorthie men that otherwise wolde be ydle. Who
can denie, as you handle the matter, and as it is in trothe,
but that it will be a terror to all princes for attemptinge
of any soodeyne invasions,<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and hable readilie to withstande

suffringe of pyrates disturbers of the common traffyke
upon these seas, yt will, as you trulye prove, utterlie
extingwishe the incorrigible, and occupie the reformed
in that honourable service.</p>

owre nation hath indurede and doe still, at strangers

navie if it may have that successe and consideration that it
deserveth, it will be a better wache for the securitie of the
state than all the intelligencers or becones that may be
devisede: and a stronger wall and bulwarke than either
Calleys was, or a brase of such townes placed in the most
convenient parte of any continente of France, or the Lowe-countrey.
As her majestie of right is <i>totius orbis Britannici
domina, et lex maris</i>, whiche is given in the reste of the
worlde by Labro in our learning to Antoninus the Emperor,
so she showlde have the execution and effect therof in

confute the stronge objectiones and argumentes that you
inforce and presse againste your selfe. I wolde God all
men wolde as willinglie beare the light burdynes that you
lay upon them for the supportation of the chardges as you

them some good occupation and exercise, they will occupie
themselves in occupationes of their owne choice, wherof
few shall be to your lykinge or meanynge. Peradventure
you meane of purpose to reserve that to the consideration
of the state. And where you in vearie good proportion,
lawierlike, share goodes taken by pyrates amonge sundrie
persones of your navie, and some portion to itselfe, reservinge
the moytie to the prince, you are to remembre that
the same are challenged holly to belong to her highnesse
by prerogative. Let me be also bold to offer to your
consideration whether it be expedient for you so freely
to deale with the carryinge of ordinawnces out of the

inserte the two orationes of Georgius Gemistus Plethon,
the one to Emanuel by fragments, and the other to his
sonne Theodore <i>ad verbum</i>, for the worthynes and varietye
of many wise and sownd advises given by him to those
princes in a hard tyme, when they were in feare of that
Turkish conquest, that did after followe to the ruine of
that empire of Constantinople. However well doeth he
handle the differences and rates of customes and tributes,
the moderate and sober use of apparell <i>in ipsis principibus</i>!
How wisely doethe<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> he condemne the takeinge up of all
the newe attires and apparell of strange nations, as though
he had written to us at this tyme, who doe offende as
deepely therein as the Greekes then dyd! How franke
is he to his prince in useinge the comparisone between
the Eagle that hath no varietie of colours of feathers,
and yet of a princelie nature and estimation, and the
Peocock, a bird of no regall propertie nor credit yet
glisteringe angelically with varietie of feathers of all
lively colours. There is one sentence in the later oration
which I have thought to note because in apparence it
dothe oppugne in a maner your treatise. The wordes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>are these, <i>Prestat long&egrave; terrestribus copiis ac militum et

<p>Yet there happened in my time one noble speaker<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[XII.]</a> who was full
of gravity in his speaking. His language (where he could
spare or passe-by a jest) was nobly censorious. No man
ever<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> spake more neatly, more pres&lt;ent&gt;ly, more weightily, or suffered
lesse emptinesse, lesse idlenesse, in what he utter'd. No member of his
speech but consisted of the owne graces: his hearers could not cough,
or looke aside from him, without losse. He commanded where he
spoke; and had his judges angry, and pleased, at his devotion. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>man had their affections more in his power. The feare of every man
that heard him was lest he should make an end.</p>

<p>Cicero is sayd to be the only wit that the people of Rome had,
equall'd to their empire, <i>ingenium par imperio</i>. We had many, and in
their severall ages (to take in but the former <i>seculum</i>) Sir Thomas
Moore, the elder Wiat, Henry, earle of Surrey, Chaloner, Smith, Eliot,
bishop Gardiner, were for their times admirable; Sir Nicholas Bacon
was singular and almost alone in the beginning of queen Elizabeth's
times; Sir Philip Sydney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew
great masters of wit and language and in whom all vigour of invention
and strength of judgment met; the earle of Essex, noble and high;
and Sir Walter Rawleigh, not to be contemn'd either for judgement or
stile; Sir Henry Savile, grave and truly letter'd; Sir Edwin Sandys,
excellent in both; lord Egerton, the Chancellour, a grave and great
orator, and best when he was provoked; but his learned and able
(though unfortunate) successor is he who hath fill'd up all numbers,
and performed that in our tongue which may be compar'd or preferr'd
either to insolent Greece or haughty Rome. In short, within his view,
and about his times, were all the wits borne that could honour
a language or helpe study. Now things dayly fall, wits grow downeward
and eloquence growes backward, so that he may be nam'd and
stand as the marke and &#7936;&#954;&#956;&#8053; of our language.</p>

<p>I have ever observ'd it to have been the office of a wise patriot
among the greatest affaires of the state to take care of the commonwealth
of learning<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>, for schooles they are the seminaries of state and
nothing is worthier the study of a statesman then that part of the
republick which wee call the advancement of letters. Witnesse the care
of Julius Caesar, who in the heate of the civill warre writ his bookes of
analogie and dedicated them to Tully. This made the lord St. Albans
entitle his worke <i>Novum Organum</i>, which though by the most of
superficiall men who cannot gett beyond the title of nominalls, it is
not penetrated nor understood, it really openeth all defects of learning
whatsoever, and is a booke</p>

<p>My conceit of his person was never increased towards him by his
place or honour, but I have and doe reverence him for the greatnesse
that was only proper to himselfe in that he seem'd to me ever by his
worke one of the greatest men and most worthy of admiration that
have been in many ages. In his adversity I ever prayed that God
would give him strength; for greatnes he could not want. Neither
could I condole in a word or syllable for him, as knowing no accident
could doe harme to vertue but rather helpe to make it manifest.</p></div>

<p><a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>He came often to Sir John Danvers at Chelsey.
Sir John told me that when his lordship had wrote the
<i>History of Henry 7</i>, he sent the manuscript copie to him
to desire his opinion of it before 'twas printed. Qd. Sir
John 'Your lordship knowes that I am no scholar.' ''Tis
no matter,' said my lord, 'I know what a schollar can say;
I would know what <i>you</i> can<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> say.' Sir John read it, and
gave his opinion what he misliked which Tacitus did not
omitt (which I am sorry I have forgott) which my lord
acknowledged to be true, and mended it: 'Why,' said he,
'a scholar would never have told me this.'</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Hobbes (Malmesburiensis) was beloved by
his lordship, who was wont to have him walke with him
in his delicate groves where he did meditate: and when
a notion darted into his mind, Mr. Hobbs was presently
to write it downe, and his lordship was wont to say that
he did it better then any one els about him; for that
many times, when he read their notes he scarce understood
what they writt, because they understood it not
clearly themselves.</p>

<p>In short, all that were <i>great and good</i> loved and honoured
him.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chiefe Justice, alwayes envyed
him, and would be undervalueing his lawe, as you may
find in my lord's lettres, and I knew old lawyers that
remembred it.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Personal characteristics.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>He was Lord Protector during King James's progresse
into Scotland, and gave audience in great state to ambassadors
in the banquetting-house at Whitehall.</p>

<p>His lordship would many times have musique in the
next roome where he meditated.</p>

<p>The aviary at Yorke-house was built by his lordship;
it did cost 300<i>li.</i></p>

<p>At every meale, according to the season of the yeare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>he had his table strewed with sweet herbes and flowers,
which he sayd did refresh his spirits and memorie.</p>

<p>When his lordship was at his country house at Gorhambery,
St. Albans seemed as if the court were<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> there,
so nobly did he live. His servants had liveries with his
crest (a boare ...); his watermen were more imployed
by gentlemen then any other, even the king's.</p>

<p>King James sent a buck to him, and he gave the keeper
fifty pounds.</p>

<p>He was wont to say to his servant Hunt, (who was
a notable thrifty man, and loved this world, and the only
servant he had that he could never gett to become bound for
him) 'The world was made for man, Hunt; and not man
for the world.' Hunt left an estate of 1000<i>li.</i> per annum
in Somerset.</p>

<p>None of his servants durst appeare before him without
Spanish leather bootes: for he would smell the neates-leather,
which offended him.</p>

<p>The East India merchants presented his lordship with
a cabinet of jewells, which his page, Mr. Cockaine, recieved,
and decieved his lord.</p>

<p>Three of his lordship's servants<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[XIII.]</a> kept their
coaches, and some kept race-horses&mdash;vide Sir
Anthony Welden's <i>Court of King James</i>.</p>

and favourites tooke bribes; but his lordship alwayes gave
judgement <i>secundum aequum et bonum</i>. His decrees in
Chancery stand firme, i.e. there are fewer of his decrees
reverst then of any other Chancellor.</p>

<p>His dowager<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> maried her gentleman-usher, Sir (Thomas,
I thinke) Underhill, whom she made deafe and blind with
too much of Venus. &#9758; She was living since the beheading
of the late King.&mdash;Quaere where and when she
died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a delicate<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>, lively hazel eie; Dr. Harvey told me
it was like the eie of a viper.</p>

<p>I have now forgott what Mr. Bushell sayd, whether his
lordship enjoyed his Muse best at night, or in the morning.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His poems.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>His lordship was a good poet, but conceal'd, as appeares
by his letters. See excellent verses of his lordship's which
Mr. Farnaby translated into Greeke, and printed both<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> in

<h4><a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[296]</a><i>Apothegmata.</i></h4>

<p>His lordship being in Yorke-house garden lookeing on
fishers as they were throwing their nett, asked them what
they would take for their draught; they answered <i>so much</i>:
his lordship would offer them no more but <i>so much</i>. They
drew-up their nett, and &lt;in&gt; it were only 2 or 3 little
fishes: his lordship then told them it had been better for
them to have taken his offer. They replied, they hoped
to have had a better draught; '<i>but</i>,' sayd his lordship,
'<i>Hope is a good breakfast, but an ill supper</i>.'</p>

<p>When his lordship was in dis-favour, his neighbours
hearing how much he was indebted, came to him with
a motion to buy Oake-wood of him. His lordship told
them, '<i>He would not sell his feathers</i>.'</p>

<p>The earle of Manchester being removed from his place
of Lord Chiefe Justice of the Common Pleas<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> to be Lord
President of the Councell, told my lord (upon his fall)
that he was sorry to see him made such an example.
Lord Bacon replied 'It did not trouble him since <i>he</i> was
made <i>a President</i>.'</p>

<p>The bishop of London did cutt-downe a noble clowd
of trees at Fulham. The Lord Chancellor told him that
he was <i>a good expounder of darke places</i>.</p>

<p>Upon his being in dis-favour his servants suddenly went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>away; he compared them to the flying of the vermin when
the howse was falling.</p>

<p>One told his Lordship it was now time to looke about
him. He replyed, 'I doe not looke <i>about</i> me, I looke
<i>above</i> me.'</p>

<p>Sir Julius C&aelig;sar (Master of the Rolles) sent to his
lordship in his necessity a hundred pounds for
a present<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[XIV.]</a>; quaere + de hoc of Michael Malet.</p>

enformations I
have from Sir
John Danvers.</p></div>

<p>His Lordship would often drinke a good
draught of strong beer (March beer) to-bedwards, to lay
his working fancy asleep: which otherwise would keepe
him from sleeping great part of the night.</p>

<p>I remember Sir John Danvers told me, that his lordship
much delighted in his curious<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> garden at Chelsey, and as
he was walking there one time, he fell downe in a dead-sowne.
My lady Danvers rubbed his face, temples, etc.
and gave him cordiall water: as soon as he came to
himselfe, sayd he, 'Madam, I am no good <i>footman</i>.'</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His death and burial.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>Mr. Hobbs told me that the cause of his lordship's
death was trying an experiment: viz., as he was taking
the aire in a coach with Dr. Witherborne (a Scotchman,
Physitian to the King) towards High-gate, snow lay on
the ground, and it came into my lord's thoughts, why
flesh might not be preserved in snow, as in salt. They
were resolved they would try the experiment presently.
They<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> alighted out of the coach, and went into a poore
woman's howse at the bottome of Highgate hill, and
bought a hen, and made the woman exenterate it, and
then stuffed the bodie with snow, and my lord did help
to doe it himselfe. The snow so chilled him, that he
immediately fell so extremely ill, that he could not returne
to his lodgings (I suppose then at Graye's Inne), but
went to the earle of Arundell's house at High-gate, where
they putt him into a good bed warmed with a panne, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>it was a damp bed that had not been layn-in in about
a yeare before, which gave him such a cold that in 2 or 3
dayes, as I remember he<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> told me, he dyed of suffocation.</p>

<p>Mr. George Herbert, Orator of the University of
Cambridge, haz made excellent verses on this great
man. So haz Mr. Abraham Cowley in his Pindariques.
Mr. Thomas Randolph of Trin. Coll. in Cambr. haz
in his poems verses on him.</p>

Gorhambery.</p>

<p>At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some
remaines of the wall of this citie<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[XVII.]</a>; which
was in compass about ... miles. This magnanimous
Lord Chancellor had a great mind
to have made it a citie again: and he had designed it,
to be built with great uniformity: but Fortune denyed
it him, though she proved kinder &lt;to&gt; the great Cardinal
Richelieu, who lived both to designe and finish that
specious towne of Richelieu, where he was borne; before,
an obscure and small vilage. (The ichnographie, etc.,
of this towne and palais is nobly engraved).</p>

<p>Within the bounds of the walls of this old citie of
Verulam (his lordship's Baronry) was Verulam howse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>about &frac12; a mile from St. Albans; which his Lordship built,
the most ingeniosely contrived little pile<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[XVIII.]</a>,
that ever I sawe. No question but his lordship
was the chiefest architect; but he had for his
assistant a favourite of his (a St. Albans man)
Mr. ... Dobson (who was his lordship's right
hand) a very ingeniose person (Master of the
Alienation Office); but he spending his estate upon
woemen<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>, necessity forced his son William Dobson to
be the most excellent painter that England hath yet bred,
qui obiit Oct. 1648; sepult. S. Martin's in the fields<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[XVIII.]</span></a> I am sorry I
measured not

<p><a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>The view of this howse from the entrance into the
gate by the high-way is thus. The parallel<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> sides answer
one another. I doe not well remember if on the east side
were bay windowes, which his lordship much affected, as
may be seen in his essay <i>Of Building</i>. Quaere whether
the number of windowes on the east side were 5 or 7:
to my best remembrance but 5. This model I drew
by memorie, 1656.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Verulam Howse<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.</span></h4>

<p>This howse did cost nine or ten thousand the building,
and was sold about 1665 or 1666 by Sir Harbottle
Grimston, baronet, (now Master of the Rolles) to two
carpenters for fower hundred poundes; of which they
made eight hundred poundes. Memorandum:&mdash;there were
good chimney-pieces; the roomes very loftie, and all
were very well wainscotted. Memorandum:&mdash;there were
two bathing-roomes or stuffes, whither his Lordship retired
afternoons as he sawe cause. All the tunnells of the
chimneys were carried into the middle of the howse, as
in this draught; and round about them were seates. The
top of the howse was well leaded. From the leads was
a lovely prospect to the ponds, which were opposite to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>east side of the howse, and were on the other side of the
stately walke of trees that leades to Gorhambery-howse:
and also over that long walke of trees, whose topps afford
a most pleasant<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> variegated verdure, resembling the
workes in Irish-stitch. The kitchin, larder, cellars, &amp;c.,
are under ground. In the middle of this howse was
a delicate staire-case of wood, which was curiously carved,
and on the posts of every interstice was some prettie
figure, as of a grave divine with his booke and spectacles,
a mendicant friar, &amp;c.&mdash;(not one thing twice). Memorandum:&mdash;on
the dores of the upper storie on the outside
(which were painted darke umber) were the figures of the
gods of the Gentiles (viz. on the south dore, 2d storie,
was Apollo; on another, Jupiter with his thunderbolt,
etc.) bigger then the life, and donne by an excellent hand;
the heightnings were of hatchings of gold, which when the
sun shone on them made a most glorious shew.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;the upper part of the uppermost dore,
on the east side, had inserted into it a large looking-glasse,
with which the stranger was very gratefully decieved, for
(after he had been entertained a pretty while, with the
prospects of the ponds, walks, and countrey, which this
dore faced) when you were about to returne into the
roome<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>, one would have sworn <i>primo intuitu</i>, that he had
beheld another prospect through the howse: for, as soon
as the stranger was landed on the balconie, the conserge<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
that shewed the howse would shutt the dore to putt this
fallacy on him with the looking-glasse. This was his
lordship's summer-howse: for he sayes (in his essay) one
should have seates for summer and winter as well as
cloathes.</p>

<p>From hence to Gorhambery is about a little mile, the
way easily ascending, hardly so acclive as a deske.</p>

<p>From hence to Gorambury in a straite line leade three
parallell walkes: in the middlemost three coaches may
passe abreast: in the wing-walkes two may. They consist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>of severall stately trees of the like groweth and heighth,
viz. elme, chesnut, beach, hornebeame, Spanish-ash, cervice-tree,
&amp;c., whose topps (as aforesaid) doe afford from the
walke on the howse the finest shew that I have seen, and
I sawe it about Michaelmas, at which time of the yeare
the colour of leaves are most varied. The manner of the
walke is thus:&mdash;</p>

pitched at the bottomes with pebbles of severall colours,
which were work't in to severall figures, as of fishes, &amp;c.
which in his lordship's time were plainly to be seen
through the cleare water, now over-grown with flagges
and rushe.</p>

<p>If a poor bodie had brought his lordship halfe a dozen
pebbles of a curious colour, he would give them a shilling,
so curious was he in perfecting his fish-ponds, which

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;about the mid-way from Verolam-house
to Gorambery, on the right hand, on the side of a hill
which faces the passer-by, are sett in artificiall manner
the afore-named trees, whose diversity of greens on the
side of the hill are exceeding pleasant. These delicate
walkes and prospects entertaine the eie to Gorambery-howse,
which is a large, well-built Gothique howse, built
(I thinke) by Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, father to
this Lord Chancellor, to whom it descended by the death
of Anthony Bacon, his middle brother, who died sans
issue.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>The Lord Chancellor made an addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a noble portico, which fronts the garden to the south:
opposite to every arch of this portico, and as big as the
arch, are drawen, by an excellent hand (but the mischief
of it is, in water-colours), curious pictures, all emblematicall,
with mottos under each: for example, one
I remember is a ship tossed in a storme, the motto, <i>Alter
erit tum Tiphys</i>. Enquire for the rest.</p>

<p>Over this portico is a stately gallerie, whose glasse-windowes
are all painted; and every pane with severall
figures of beast, bird, or flower: perhaps his lordship might
use them as topiques for locall memory. The windowes
looke into the garden, the side opposite to them no
window, but that side is hung all with pictures at length,
as of King James, his lordship, and severall illustrious
persons of his time. At the end you enter is no windowe,
but there is a very large picture, thus:&mdash;in the middle on
a rock in the sea stands King James in armour, with his
regall ornaments; on his right hand stands (but whither or
no on a rock I have forgott), King Henry 4 of France, in
armour; and on his left hand, the King of Spaine, in like
manner. These figures are (at least) as big as the life,
they are donne only with umbre and shell gold: all the
heightning and illuminated part being burnisht gold, and
the shadowed umbre, as in the pictures of the gods on the
dores of Verolam-house. The roofe of this gallerie is
semi-cylindrique, and painted by the same hand and same
manner, with heads and busts of Greek and Roman
emperours and heroes.</p>

<p>In the hall (which is of the auncient building) is a large
storie very well painted of the feastes of the gods, where
Mars is caught in a nett by Vulcan. On the wall, over
the chimney, is painted an oake with akornes falling from it;
the word, <i>Nisi quid potius</i>. And on the wall, over the table,
is painted Ceres teaching the soweing of corne; the word,
<i>Moniti meliora</i>.</p>

<p>The garden is large, which was (no doubt) rarely planted
and kept in his lordship's time: vide vitam Peireskii de
domino Bacon. Here is a handsome dore, which opens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
into Oake-wood; over this dore in golden letters on
blew are these six verses<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>The oakes of this wood are very great and shadie.
His lordship much delighted himselfe here: under every
tree he planted some fine flower, or flowers, some wherof
are there still (1656), viz. paeonies, tulips,....</p>

<p>From this wood a dore opens into ..., a place as big as
an ordinary parke, the west part wherof is coppice-wood,
where are walkes cutt-out as straight as a line, and broade
enoug for a coach, a quarter of a mile long or better.&mdash;Here
his lordship much<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> meditated, his servant Mr. Bushell
attending him with his pen and inke horne to sett downe
his present notions.&mdash;Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me, that
his lordship would employ him often in this service
whilest he was there, and was better pleased with his
<i>minutes</i>, or notes sett downe by him, then by others who
did not well understand his lordship. He told me that he
was employed in translating part of the Essayes, viz. three
of them, one wherof was that of the Greatnesse of Cities,
the other two I have now forgott.</p>

<p>The east of this parquet (which extends to Veralam-howse)
was heretofore, in his lordship's prosperitie, a
paradise; now is a large ploughed field. This eastern
division consisted of severall parts; some thicketts of
plumme-trees with delicate walkes; some of rasberies.
Here was all manner of fruit-trees that would grow in
England; and a great number of choice forest-trees; as the
whitti-tree, sorbe-, cervice-, etc., eugh<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. The walke&lt;s&gt;, both
in the coppices and other boscages, were most ingeniosely
designed: at severall good viewes<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, were erected elegant
sommer-howses well built of Roman architecture, well
wainscotted and cieled; yet standing, but defaced, so
that one would have thought the Barbarians had made
a conquest here. This place in his lordship's time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>a sanctuary for phesants, partridges, etc. birds of severall
kinds and countries, as white, speckled etc., partridges. In
April, and the springtime, his lordship would, when it rayned,
take his coach (open) to recieve the benefit of irrigation,
which he was wont to say was very wholsome because of
the nitre in the aire and the <i>universall spirit of the world</i>.</p>

<p>His lordship was wont to say, <i>I will lay my mannor of
Gorambery on't</i>, to which Judge ... made a spightfull
reply, saying he would not hold a wager against that, but
against <i>any other</i> mannour of his lordship's he would.
Now this illustrious Lord Chancellor had only this mannor
of Gorambery.</p>

<h3><b>Isaac Barrow</b> (1630-1677).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>Isaac Barrow, D.D.&mdash;from his father, (who was borne
Aprill 22, 1600, &frac12; a yeare older then King Charles 1st),
May 17, 1682.</p>

<p>His father, Thomas Barrow, was the second son of Isaac
Barrow of Spinney Abbey in the countie of Cambridge,
esq., who was a Justice of the Peace there above fourtie
yeares. The father of Thomas never designed him for
a tradesman, but he was so severe to him &lt;that&gt; he could
not endure to live with him and so came to London and
was apprentice to a linnen-draper. He kept shop at the
signe of the White-horse in Forster lane near St. Forster's
church in St. Leonard's parish; and &lt;his son<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>&gt; was
christened at St. John Zacharie's in Forster lane, for
at that time St. Leonard's church was pulled downe to
be re-edified. He was borne anno Dni 1630 in October<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
after King Charles II<sup>nd</sup>. Dr. Isaac Barrow had the exact
day and hower of his father, which may be found amongst
his papers. His father sett it downe in his English bible,
a faire one, which they used at the king's chapell when he
was in France and he could not get it again. His father
travelled with the King, Charles 2<sup>nd</sup>, where ever he went;
he was sealer to the Lord Chancellor beyond sea, and
so when he came into England. Amongst Dr. Barrowe's
papers it may be found. Dr. Tillotson has all his papers&mdash;quaere
for it, and for the names of all writings both in
print and MSS.</p>

<p>He went to schoole, first to Mr. Brookes at Charterhouse
two yeares. His father gave to Mr. Brookes 4 <i>li.</i> per
annum, wheras his pay was but 2 <i>li.</i>, to be carefull of him;
but Mr. Brokes was negligent of him, which the captain
of the school acquainted his father (his kinsman) and sayd
that he would not have him stay there any longer than
he<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> did, for that he337<a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> instructed him.</p>

<p>Afterwards to one Mr. Holbitch, about fower years, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Felton<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> in Essex; from whence he was admitted of Peterhouse
College in Cambridge first, and went to schoole
a yeare after. Then he was admitted of Trinity College
in Cambridge at 13 yeares old.</p>

<p>Quaere whose daughter his mother was.</p>

<p>His mother was Anne, daughter of William Buggin of
North Cray in Kent, esq. She died when her sonne Isaac
was about fower yeares old.</p>

<p>Anno Domini ... he travelled, and returned, anno
Domini....</p>

<p>He wrote.... What MSS.?&mdash;quaere Dr. Tillotson,
and quaere Mr. Brabazon Aylmer, bookseller, nere Exchange
Alley.</p>

<p>His humour when a boy and after:&mdash;merry and cheerfull
and beloved where ever he came. His grandfather kept
him till he was 7 years old: his father was faine to force
him away, for there he would have been good for nothing
there.</p>

<p>A good poet, English and Latin. He spake 8 severall
languages.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>His father dealt in his trade to Ireland where he
had a great losse, neer 1000 <i>li.</i>; upon which he wrote to
Mr. Holbitch, a Puritan, to be pleased to take a little
paines more than ordinary with him, because the times
growing so bad, and such a losse then received, that he
did not knowe how he might be able to provide for him,
and so Mr. Holbitch tooke him away from the howse where
he was boarded to his owne howse, and made him tutor
to my lord viscount Fairfax, ward to the lord viscount
Say and Seale, where he continued so long as my lord
continued.</p>

<p>This viscount Fairfax<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> died a young man. This viscount
Fairfax, being a schooleboy, maried a gentleman's daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>in the towne there, who had but a thousand pounds. So
leaving the schoole, would needs have Mr. Isaac Barrow
with him, and told him he would maintaine him. But
the lord Say was so cruel to him that he would not allow
anything that 'tis thought he dyed for want. The 1000 <i>li.</i>
could not serve him long.</p>

<p>During this time old Mr. Thomas Barrow was shutt-up
at Oxford and could not heare of his sonne. But young
Isaac's master, Holbitch, found him out in London and
courted him to come to his schoole and that he would make
him his heire. But he did not care to goe to schoole again.</p>

<p>When my lord Fairfax faild and that he sawe he grew
heavy upon him, he went to see one of his schoolfellowes,
one Mr. Walpole, a Norfolke gent., who asked him 'What
he would doe?' He replyed he 'knew not what to doe;
he could not goe to his father at Oxford.' Mr. Walpole
then told him 'I am goeing to Cambridge to Trinity College
and I will maintaine you there'; and so he did for halfe
a yeare till the surrender of Oxford; and then his father
enquired after him and found him at Cambridge. And
the very next day after old Mr. Barrow came to Cambridge,
Mr. Walpole was leaving the University and (hearing
nothing of Isaac's father) resolved to take Isaac along with
him to his howse. His father then asked him what profession
he would be of, a merchant or etc.? He begd
of his father to lett him continue in the University. His
father then asked what would maintain him. He told
him 20 <i>li.</i> per annum: 'I warrant you,' sayd he, 'I will
maintaine myselfe with it.' His father replyed 'I'le make
a shift to allow you that.' So his father then went to his
tutor and acquainted him of, etc. His tutor, Dr. Duport,
told him that he would take nothing for his reading to
him, for that he was likely to make a brave scholar, and
he would helpe him to halfe a chamber for nothing. And
the next newes his father heard of him was that he was
chosen in to the howse.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>Dr. Hill<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> was then master of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>the college. He mett Isaac<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> one day and layd his hand
upon his head and sayd 'thou art a good boy; 'tis pitty
that thou art a cavalier.'</p>

<p>He was a strong and a stowt man and feared not any man.
He would fight with the butchers' boyes in St. Nicholas'
shambles, and be hard enough for any of them.</p>

<p>He went to travell 3 or 4 yeares after the king was
beheaded, upon the colledge account<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. He was a candidate
for the Greeke professor's place, and had the consent of
the University but Oliver Cromwell putt in Dr. Widrington<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>;
and then he travelled.</p>

<p>He was abroad 5 yeares<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>, viz. in Italie, France, Germany,
Constantinople.</p>

<p>As he went to Constantinople, two men of warre
(Turkish shippes) attacqued the vessell wherin he was.
In which engagement he shewed much valour in defending
the vessell; which the men that were in that engagement
often testifye, for he never told his father of it himselfe.</p>

<p>Upon his returne, he came in &lt;a&gt; ship to Venice, which
was stowed with cotton-wooll, and as soon as ever they
came on shore the ship fell on fire, and was utterly consumed,
and not a man lost, but not any goods saved&mdash;a
wonderfull preservation.</p>

<p>His personall valour&mdash;At Constantinople, being in company
with the English merchants, there was a Rhadamontade
that would fight with any man and bragged of his valour,
and dared any man there to try him. So no man accepting
his challenge, said Isaac (not then a divine), 'Why, if none
els will try you I will'; and fell upon him and chastised
him handsomely that he vaunted no more amongst them.</p>

<p>After he had been 3 years beyond sea, his correspondent
dyed, so that he had no more supply; yet he was so well
beloved that he never wanted.</p>

<p>At Constantinople he wayted on the consul Sir Thomas
Bendish, who made him stay with him and kept him there
a yeare and a halfe, whether he would or no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>At Constantinople, Mr. Dawes (afterwards Sir Jonathan
Dawes, who dyed sherif of London), a Turkey merchant,
desired Mr. Barrow to stay but such a time and he would
returne with him, but when that time came he could not
goe, some businesse stayd him. Mr. Barrow could stay
no longer; so Mr. Dawes would have had Mr. Barrow have
C<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> pistolles. 'No,' said Mr. Barrow, 'I know not whether
I shall be able to pay you.' ''Tis no matter,' said
Mr. Dawes. To be short, forced him to take fifty pistolls,
which at his returne he payd him again.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>Memorandum, his pill (an opiate, possibly Matthews
his pil), which he was wont to take in Turkey, which was
wont to doe him good, but he tooke it preposterously at
Mr. Wilson's, the sadler's, neer Suffolke-house, where he
was wont to lye and where he dyed, and 'twas the cause of
his death&mdash;quaere + de hoc there.</p>

<p>As he lay expiring<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> in the agonie of death, the standers-by
could heare him say softly 'I have seen the glories of
the world'&mdash;&lt;from&gt; Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>I have heard Mr. Wilson say that when he was at study,
was so intent at it that when the bed was made, or so, he
heeded it not nor perceived it, was so <i>totus in hoc</i>; and
would sometimes be goeing out without his hatt on.</p>

<p>He was by no meanes a spruce man<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>, but most negligent
in his dresse. As he was walking one day in St. James's
parke, looking ..., his hatt up, his cloake halfe on and
halfe off, a gent. came behind him and clapt him on the
shoulder and sayd 'Well, goe thy wayes for the veriest
scholar that ever I<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> mett with.'</p>

<p>This Sir Henry Billingsley was one of the learnedst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>citizens that London has bred. This was he that putt forth
all Euclid's Elements in English with learned notes and
preface of Mr. John Dee, and learned men say 'tis the best
Euclid. He had been sheriff and Lord Mayor of the
city of London. His howse was the faire howse in Fenchurch
street where now Jacob Luce lives, a merchant, of
of whom quaere +. Vide in Fuller's Worthies and Stowe's
Survey. His Euclid was printed at London by John
Day, 1570.</p>

into our tongue and to publish abroad such good authors
and bookes: Seeing moreover that many good witts, both
of gentlemen and others of all degrees, much desirous and
studious of these artes,&mdash;I have for their sakes with some
chardge and great travaile faithfully translated into our
vulgar tounge and set abroad in print this booke of Euclid
wherunto I have added plaine declarations and examples,
manifold additions, scholies, annotations, and inventions
which I have gathered.'&mdash;He promises (here) some more
translations and sayes that in religion he hath alreadie
don, quaere.</p>

<p>Memorandum P. Ramus in his Scholia's sayes that the
reason why mathematiques did most flourish in Germanie
was that the best authors were rendred into their mother

their owne tongue&mdash;quod nota bene.</p>

gentleman of the horse to Richard, earl of Dorset. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>managed the great horse best of any man in England. He
taught the Prince Elector and brothers to ride. Quaere if

<p>In those dayes<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> merchants travelled much abroad into

<h3><b>John Birkenhead</b> (1615-1679).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>Sir John Birkenhead, knight, was borne at Nantwych<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
in Cheshire. His father was a sadler there, and he had a
brother a sadler, a trooper in Sir Thomas Ashton's regiment,
who was quartered at my father's, who told me so.</p>

<p>He went to Oxford university at ... old, and was
first a servitor of Oriall colledge: vide <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i><a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
Mr. Gwin<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>, minister of Wilton, was his contemporary
there, who told me he wrote an excellent hand, and, in
163[7 or 8] when William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury,
was last there, he had occasion to have some things well
transcribed, and this Birkenhead was recommended to him,
who performed<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> his businesse so well, that the archbishop
recommended him to All Soules' college to be a fellow,
and he was accordingly elected<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. He was scholar enough,
and a poet.</p>

<p>After Edgehill fight, when King Charles I first had his
court at Oxford, he was pitched upon as one fitt to write
the Newes, which Oxford Newes was called <i>Mercurius
Aulicus</i>, which he writt wittily enough, till the surrender
of the towne (which was June 24, 1646). He left a
collection of all his <i>Mercurius Aulicus's</i> and all his other
pamphletts, which his executors (Sir Richard Mason and
Sir Muddiford Bramston) were ordered by the king to
give to the Archbishop of Canterbury's library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>After the surrender of Oxford, he was putt out of his
fellowship by the Visitors, and was faine to shift for himselfe
as well as he could. Most part of his time he spent
at London, where he mett with severall persons of quality
that loved his company, and made much of him.</p>

<p>He went over into France, where he stayed some time,
I thinke not long. He received grace there from the
dutches of Newcastle, I remember he tolde me.</p>

<p>He gott many a fourty shillings (I beleeve) by pamphletts,
such as that of 'Col. Pride,' and 'The Last Will and Testament
of Philip earle of Pembroke,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>At the restauration of his majestie he was made Master
of the Facultees, and afterwards one of the Masters of
Requests. He was exceedingly confident<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>, witty, not very
gratefull to his benefactors, would lye damnably. He was
of midling stature, great goggli eies, not of a sweet aspect.</p>

<p>He was chosen a burghes of Parliament at Wilton in
Wiltshire, anno Domini 166&lt;1&gt;, i.e. of the King's long
parliament. Anno 167&lt;9&gt; upon the choosing of <i>this</i>
Parliament<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>, he went downe to be elected, and at Salisbury
heard<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> how he was scorned and mocked at Wilton (whither
he was goeing) and called <i>Pensioner</i>, etc.&mdash;</p>

the famous singer) in St. James's parke, &lt;on&gt; Michaelmas-eve
1696, aged about 80.</p>

<p>He was borne in London &lt;at the&gt; Paul-head tavern

presume) at Tittinghanger in the countie of Hertford.
It was heretofore the summer seate of the Lord Abbot
of St. Alban's.</p>

<p>He was of Trinity College in Oxford<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>, where was
a great acquaintance<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> between him and Mr. Francis
Potter. He stayed there about &lt;four&gt; yeares. From
thence he went to Grayes Inne, where he stayd ...
and then sold his chamber there to Mr. Thomas Bonham<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a>
(the poet) and travelled&mdash;voyage into the Levant. May 7,
1634, he embarqued at Venice for Constantinople: vide
his <i>Voyage into the Levant</i>, printed London 16&mdash;, in 4to.
He returned....</p>

<p>He was pretty wild when young, especially addicted to
common wenches. He was a 2d brother.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman pensioner to King Charles I, on
whom he wayted (as it was his turne) to Yorke (when the
King deserted the Parliament); was with him at Edge-hill
fight; came with him to Oxford; and so returned to
London; walkt<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> into Westminster hall with his sword by
his side; the Parliamentarians all stared upon him as
a <i>Cavaleer</i>, knowing that he had been with the King:
was called before the House of Commons, where he
remonstrated to them he did but his duty, and so they
acquitted him.</p>

<p>In these dayes he dined most commonly at the Heycock's<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
ordinary, neer the Pallzgrave-head taverne, in the
Strand, which was much frequented by Parliament-men
and gallants. One time colonel Betridge being there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>(one<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> of the handsomest men about the towne) and
bragged much how the woemen loved him; Sir H. Blount
did lay a wager of ... with him that let them two goe
together to a bordello; he only (without money) with his
handsome person, and Sir Henry with a <span class="smcap">XX</span><i>s.</i> piece on his
bald crowne, that the wenches should choose Sir Henry
before Betridge; and Sir H. won the wager. E&lt;dmund&gt;
W&lt;yld&gt;, esq., was one of the witnesses.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;there was about 164.. a pamphlet
(writt by Henry Nevill, esq., &#7936;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#8182;&#962;) called <i>The Parliament
of Ladies</i>, 3 or 4 sheets in 4to, wherin Sir
Henry Blount was first to be called to the barre for
spreading abroad that abominable and dangerous doctrine
that it was far cheaper and safer to lye with common
wenches<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> then with ladies of quality<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.</p>

<p>&#9758; His estate left him by his father was 500 <i>li.</i> per
annum, which he sold to ... (quaere) for an annuitie
of 1000 <i>li.</i> per annum in anno Domini 16..; and since
his elder brother dyed.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 165&lt;[*&frac12;]&gt; he was made one of the comittee
for regulating the lawes. He was severe against tythes,
and for the abolishing them, and that every minister
should have 100 <i>li.</i> per annum and no more.</p>

<p>Since he was ... year old he dranke nothing but
water or coffee. 1647 or therabout, he maryed to Mris
[Hester[d]] Wase, [daughter of Christopher Wase<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>], who
dyed 1679; by whom he haz two sonnes, ingeniose young
gentlemen. Charles Blount (his second son) hath writt
<i>Anima Mundi</i>, 8vo, 167&lt;9&gt; (burnt by order of the bishop
of London) and of <i>Sacrifices</i>, 8vo.</p>

<p>I remember twenty yeares since he inveighed much
against sending youths to the universities&mdash;quaere if his
sons there&mdash;because they learnt there to be debaucht; and
that the learning that they learned there<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> they were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>unlearne againe, as a man that is buttond or laced too hard,
must unbutton before he can be at his ease. Drunkennesse
he much exclaimed against, but he allowed wenching.
When coffee first came-in he was a great upholder of it,
and hath ever since been a constant frequenter of coffee
houses, especially Mr. ... Farre at the Rainbowe by Inner
Temple Gate, and lately John's coffee house in Fuller's rents.</p>

<p>&#9758; The first coffee house in London<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[XXIII.]</a>
was in St. Michael's Alley in Cornehill,
opposite to the Church; which was sett up by
one ... Bowman (coachman to Mr. Hodges,
a Turkey merchant, who putt him upon it) in or about
the yeare 1652. 'Twas about 4 yeares before any other
was sett up, and that was by Mr. Far. Jonathan Paynter,
opposite to St. Michael's Church, was the first apprentice
to the trade, viz. to Bowman. Memorandum:&mdash;the Bagneo,
in Newgate Street, was built and first opened in Decemb.
1679: built by ... (Turkish merchants).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[XXIII.]</span></a> And the next
was Mr. Farr's
a barber, which
was set up in
anno....</p></div>

<p>He is a gentleman of a very clear judgement, great
experience, much contemplation, not of very much reading,
of great foresight into government. His conversation is
admirable. When he was young, he was a great collector
of bookes, as his sonne is now.</p>

<p>He was heretofore a great <i>shammer</i>, i.e. one that tells
falsities not to doe any body any injury, but to impose
on their understanding:&mdash;e.g. at Mr. Farre's; that at an
inne (nameing the signe) in St. Alban's, the inkeeper had
made a hogs-trough of a free-stone coffin; but the pigges,
after that, grew leane, dancing and skipping, and would
run up on the topps of the houses like goates. Two
young gentlemen that heard Sir H. tell this <i>sham</i> so
gravely, rode the next day to St. Alban's to enquire:
comeing there, nobody had heard of any such thing, 'twas
altogether false. The next night as soon as the&lt;y&gt;
allighted, they came to the Rainbowe and found Sir H.,
looked louringly on him, and told him they wonderd he
was not ashamed to tell such storys as, &amp;c., 'Why,
gentlemen,' (sayd Sir H.) 'have you been there to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
enquiry?' 'Yea,' sayd they. 'Why truly, gentlemen,'
sayd Sir H. 'I heard you tell strange things that I knew
to be false. I would not have gonne over the threshold
of the dore to have found you in a lye:' at which all the
company laught at the two young gentlemen.</p>

<p>He was wont to say that he did not care to have his
servants goe to church, for there servants infected one
another to goe to the alehouse and learne debauchery;
but he did bid them goe to see the executions at Tyburne,
which worke more upon them then all the oratory in the
sermons.</p>

<p>His motto over his printed picture is that which I have
many yeares ago heard him speake of, viz.:&mdash;<i>Loquendum
est cum vulgo, sentiendum cum sapientibus</i>.</p>

<p>He is now (1680) neer or altogether 80 yeares, his
intellectualls good still, and body pretty strong.</p>

<p>This last weeke<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> of Sept. 1682, he was taken very ill at
London, and his feet swelled; and removed to Tittinghanger.</p>

London.</p>

<p>He was borne in the middle of Mincing Lane, in the
parish of Saint Dunstan's in the East, London, anno 1622,
May 7th, at six a clock in the morning. Went to schoole
at Mercers Chapell, under Mr. Augur. At 9 sent into the
Lowe Countreys; then returned, and perfected himselfe
in the Latin and Greeke. &lt;At&gt; 14, travelled into France
and Italie, Switzerland, Germany, and the Lowe Countreys.
Returned into England at 19; then lived with one Hoste,
a banquier, 8 yeares, was his cashier 8 or 9 yeares. Then
traded for himselfe (27) till he was 31; then maried the
only daughter of William de Vischer, a merchant; lived
18 yeares with her, then continued single. Left off trade
at 32, and retired to a countrey life, by reason of his
indisposition, the ayre of the citie not agreing with him.
Then in these retirements he wrote <i>Active<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Philosophy</i>,
(a thing not donne before) wherin are enumerated all the
Arts and Tricks practised in Negotiation, and how they
were to be ballanced by counter-prudentiall rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilest he lived with Mr. Hoste, he kept the cash of
the ambassadors of Spaine that were here; and of the
farmers, called by them <i>Assentistes</i>, that did furnish the
Spanish and Imperiall armies of the Low-Countreys and
Germany; and also many other great cashes, as of
Sir Theodore Mayern, etc.; his dealing being altogether
in money-matters: by which meanes he became acquainted
with the ministers of state both here and abroad.</p>

<p>When he was abroad, his chiefe employment was to
observe the affaires of state and their judicatures, and
to take the politique surveys in the countreys he travelled
thorough, more especially in relation to trade. He
speakes<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> the Low-Dutch, High-Dutch, French, Italian,
Spanish and Lingua Franco, and Latin, besides his owne.</p>

<p>When he retired from businesse he studied the Lawe-Merchant,
and admitted himselfe of the Inner Temple,
London, about 1660. His judgment haz been taken in
most of the great causes of his time in points concerning
the Lawe-Merchant. As to his person he is about 5 foot
high, slender<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>, strait, haire exceeding black and curling
at the end, a dark hazell<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> eie, of a midling size, but the
most sprightly that I have beheld. Browes and beard
of the colour as his haire. A person of great temperance,
and deepe thoughts, and a working head, never
idle. From<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> 14 he had a candle burning by him all
night, with pen, inke, and paper, to write downe thoughts
as they came into his head; that so he might not loose
a thought. Was ever a great lover of Naturall Philosophie.
His whole life has been perplex't in lawe-suites, (which haz
made him expert in humane affaires), in which he alwaies
over-came. He had many lawe-suites with powerfull
adversaries; one lasted 18 yeares. Red-haired men never
had any kindnesse for him. He used to say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">In rufa pelle non est animus sine felle.</p>

<p>In all his travells he was never robbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>He has one son, and one daughter who resembles him.</p>

<p>From 14 he began to take notice of all prudentiall rules
as came in his way, and wrote them downe, and so continued
till this day, Sept. 28, 1680, being now in his
59th yeare.</p>

<p>For his health he never had it very well, but indifferently,
alwaies a weake stomach, which proceeded from the
agitation of the braine. His dyet was alwayes fine diet:
much chicken<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.</p>

<p>He wrote a Table of all the Exchanges in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>He hath writt (which is in his custodie, and which

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pag. 44.&mdash;'She was truly excellent and great in all respects: great in
the honour of her birth, being born a lady and a virtuosa both; seventh
daughter of that eminently honourable, Richard, the first earle of Cork;
who being born a private gentleman, and younger brother of a younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>brother, to no other heritage than is expressed in the device and motto,
which his humble gratitude inscribed on all the palaces he built,</p>

<p class="center"><i>God's Providence, mine Inheritance</i>;</p>

<p>by that Providence, and his diligent and wise industry, raised such an
honour and estate, and left such a familie, as never any subject of these
three kingdomes did, and that with so unspotted a reputation of
integrity that the most invidious scrutiny could find no blott, though
it winnowed all the methods of his rising most severely, which our
good lady hath often told me with great content and satisfaction.</p>

<p>This noble lord, by his prudent and pious consort, no lesse an
ornament and honour to their descendants than himself, was blessed
with five sonnes, (of which he lived to see four lords and peeres of the
kingdome of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and a fifth, more than these titles speak,
a soveraigne and peerlesse in a larger province,&mdash;that of universall
nature, subdued and made obsequious to his inquisitive mind), and
eight daughters. And that you may remark how all things were
extraordinary in this great personage, it will, I hope, be neither
unpleasant, nor impertinent, to add a short story I had from our lady's
own mouth:&mdash;Master Boyl, after earle of Cork (who was then a
widdower), came one morning to waite on Sir Jeofry Fenton, at that
time a great officer<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[XXIV.]</a> of state in that kingdome of
Ireland, who being ingaged in business, and not knowing
who it was who desired to speake with him, a while
delayed him access; which time he spent pleasantly with his young
daughter in her nurse's arms. But when Sir Jeoffry came, and saw
whom he had made stay somewhat too long, he civilly excused
it. But master Boyl replied, he had been very well entertayned;
and spent his time much to his satisfaction, in courting his daughter,
if he might obtaine the honour to be accepted for his son-in-lawe.
At which Sir Jeoffry, smiling (to hear one who had been formerly
married, move for a wife carried in arms, and under two years old,)
asked him if he would stay for her? To which he frankly answered
him he would, and Sir Jeoffry as generously promised him he should
then have his consent. And they both kept their words honourably.
And by this virtuous lady he had thirteen children, ten of which he
lived to see honourably married, and died a grandfather by the
youngest of them.</p>

<p>Nor did she derive less honour from the collateral, than the descending

<p>The female branches also (if it be lawfull so to call

degree, the present earle being the six and twentieth, or the seaven
and twentieth, of lineal descent: and, as I have heard, it was that
great antiquary King Charles the First his observation, that the three
ancientest families of Europe for nobility, were the <i>Veres</i> in England,
earls of Oxford, and the <i>Fitz-Geralds</i> in Ireland, earls of Kildare, and

Kildare is a mixture of blood of Fitz-Geralds and Veres;</p>

Ranelaugh<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[XXVI.]</a>, and mother to the present generous earle
of Ranelaugh, of which family I could have added an
eminent remark, I meet with in Fuller's "Worthies;"

this noble train (for the eighth, the lady Margaret, died unmaried),
was our excellent lady Mary, married to Charles, earle of Warwick; of

A leaf containing an earlier draft of this life (as shown by the coat tricked in
the inner margin) has been cut out between fol. 14 and fol. 15 of MS. Aubr. 6.
The excision was made by Aubrey himself, a line being drawn by him across the
excision from fol. 14<sup>v</sup> to fol. 15, to mark the transposition of a passage. The
reason for the cutting out of this leaf is suggested in a letter of Aubrey to
Anthony Wood (MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 360, July 14, 1681), where he says his
'Lives' contain 'severe touches on the earl of Corke, Dr. Wallis, etc.' In the
margin of the excised leaf a note, given on the authority of 'Mr. A. E.' i.e.
Anthony Ettrick, seems to speak of amours and bastards of the earl.</p></div>

antiquities and architecture of Rome, he esteemed none<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
any where els.</p>

<p>He speakes Latin very well, and very readily, as most
men I have mett with. I have heard him say that when
he was young, he read over Cowper's dictionary: wherin
I thinke he did very well, and I beleeve he is much beholding
to him for his mastership of that language.</p>

him the mannor of Stalbridge in com. Dorset, where is
a great freestone house; it was forfeited by the earle of
Castlehaven.</p>

<p>He is very tall (about six foot high) and streight, very
temperate, and vertuouse, and frugall: a batcheler; keepes
a coach; sojournes with his sister, the lady Ranulagh. His
greatest delight is chymistrey. He haz at his sister's
a noble laboratory, and severall servants (prentices to him)
to looke to it. He is charitable to ingeniose men that
are in want, and foreigne chymists have had large proofe
of his bountie, for he will not spare for cost to gett any
rare secret. At his owne costs and chardges he gott
translated and printed the New Testament in Arabique<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a>,
to send into the Mahometan countreys. He has not
only a high renowne in England, but abroad; and when
foreigners come to hither, 'tis one of their curiosities
to make him a visit.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>Henry Briggs was borne at ... (vide Anthony
Wood's <i>Oxon. Antiquit.</i>: quaere his nephew who is beadle
to Stationers' Hall; quaere <i>Vaticinium Carolinum</i>, an
English poem).</p>

<p>He was first of St. John's College in Cambridge.
Sir Henry Savill sent for him and made him his geometrie
professor. He lived at Merton College in Oxon, where he
made the dialls at the buttresses of the east end of the
chapell with a bullet for the axis.</p>

<p>He travelled into Scotland to comune with the honourable ...
lord Nepier<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> of Marcheston about making the
logarithmicall tables.</p>

<p>&#9758; Looking one time on the mappe of England he
observed that the<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> two rivers, the Thames and that Avon
which runnes to Bathe and so to Bristowe, were not far
distant, scilicet, about 3 miles&mdash;vide the mappe. He
sees 'twas but about 25 miles from Oxford; getts a horse
and viewes it and found it to be a levell ground and<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> easie
to be digged. Then he considered the chardge of cutting
between them and the convenience of making a mariage
between those rivers which would be of great consequence
for cheape and safe carrying of goods between London
and Bristow, and though the boates<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> goe slowly and with
meanders, yet considering they goe day and night they
would be at their journey's end almost as soon as the
waggons, which often are overthrowne and liquours spilt
and other goods broken. Not long after this he dyed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>the civill warres brake-out. It happened by good luck
that one Mr. Matthewes of Dorset had some acquaintance
with this Mr.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Briggs and had heard him discourse of
it. He was an honest simple man, and had runne out of
his estate and this project did much run in his head. He
would revive it (or els it had been lost and forgott) and
went into the country to make an ill survey of it (which
he printed) about anno ..., but with no great encouragement
of the countrey or others. Upon the restauration
of King Charles II he renewed his designe and applyed
himselfe to the king and counsell. His majestie espoused
it more (he told me) then any one els. In short, for want
of management and his non-ability, it came to nothing,
and he is now dead of old age. But Sir Jonas Moore
( &#9758; an expert mathematician and a practicall man), being
sent to survey the mannor of Dantesey in Wilts (which
was forfeited to the crowne by Sir John Danvers his
foolery), went to see these streames and distances. He
told me the streames were too small unlesse in winter;
but if some prince or the Parliament would rayse money
to cutt through the hill by Wotton-Basset which is not
very high, then there would be water enough and streames
big enough. He computed the chardge, which I have
forgott, but I thinke it was about 200,000 <i>li.</i></p>

<p>Mris. Elizabeth Broughton was daughter of ...
Broughton of ... in Herefordshire, an ancient family.
Her father lived at the mannour-house at Canon-Peon.
Whether she was borne there or no, I know not: but
there she lost her mayden-head to a poor young fellow,
then I beleeve handsome, but, in 1660, a pittifull poor
old weaver, clarke of the parish. He had fine curled
haire, but gray. Her father at length discoverd her
inclinations and locked her up in the turret of the house,
but she (like a ...) getts downe by a rope; and away she
gott to London, and did sett-up for her selfe.</p>

<p>She was a most exquisite beautie, as finely shaped as
nature could frame; and had a delicate witt. She was
soon taken notice of at London, and her price was very
deare&mdash;a second Thais. Richard, earle of Dorset, kept
her (whether before or after Venetia<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>, I know not, but
I guesse before). At last she grew common and infamous
and gott<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> the pox, of which she died.</p>

<p>I remember thus much of an old song of those dayes,

<p>I doe remember her father (1646), neer 80, the handsomest
shaped man that ever my eies beheld, a very wise
man and of an admirable elocution. He was a committee-man
in Herefordshire and Glocestershire. He was
commissary to colonel Massey. He was of the Puritan
party heretofore; had a great guift in praying, etc. His
wife (I have heard my grandmother say, who was her
neighbor) had as great parts as he. He was the first that
used the improvement of land by soape-ashes when he
lived at Bristowe, where they then threw it away.</p>

<h3><b>Thomas Bushell</b> (1594-1674).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>Mr. Thomas Bushell was an ... shire man, borne ...:
quaere Thomas Mariet, esq. [He<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> was borne at
Marston in ... shire, neer him.]</p>

<p>He was one of the gentlemen that wayted on the Lord
Chancellour Bacon. 'Twas the fashion in those dayes for
gentlemen to have their suites of clothes garnished with
buttons. My Lord Bacon was then in disgrace, and his
man Bushell having more buttons then usuall on his
cloake, etc., they sayd that his lord's breech made buttons
and Bushell wore them&mdash;from whence he was called
<i>buttond Bushell</i>.</p>

<p>He was only an English scholar, but had a good witt
and a working and contemplative head. His lord much
loved him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>His genius lay most towards naturall philosophy, and
particularly towards the discovery, drayning, and improvement
of the silver mines in Cardiganshire<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>, etc.</p>

<p>He had the strangest bewitching way to drawe-in
people (yea, discreet and wary men) into his projects
that ever I heard of. His tongue was a chaine and drewe
in so many to be bound for him and to be ingaged in his
designes that he ruined a number. Mr. Goodyere of ...
in Oxfordshire was undon by him among others; see<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
part iii. pag. 6 b.</p>

<p>He was master of the art of running in debt, and lived
so long that his depts were forgott, so that they were the
great-grandchildren of the creditors.</p>

<p>He wrote a stich't treatise of mines and improving of
the adits to them and bellowes to drive-in wind, which
Sir John Danvers, his acquaintance, had, and nayled
it<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a> to his parlor-wall at Chelsey, with some scheme, and
I beleeve is there yet: I sawe it there about 10 yeares
since.</p>

<p>During the time of the civill warres, he lived in Lundy
island.</p>

<p>Anno 1647 or 8, he came over into England; and when
he landed at Chester, and had but one Spanish threepence
(this I had then from ... of Great Tew, to whom he
told it), and, sayd he, 'I<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> could have been contented to have
begged a penny, like a poor man.' At that time he sayd
he owed, I forgett whether it was 50 or sixty thousand
pounds: but he was like Sir Kenelm Digby, if he had
not 4<i>d.</i>, wherever he came he would find respect and
credit.</p>

<p>&#9758; Memorandum, after his master the lord chancellor dyed,
he maried ..., and lived at Enston, Oxon; where having
some land lyeing on the hanging of a hill faceing the south,
at the foot wherof runnes a fine cleare stream which petrifies,
and where is a pleasant solitude, he spake to his servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Jack<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[XXX.]</a> Sydenham to gett a labourer to cleare some boscage
which grew on the side of the hill, and also
to dig<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> a cavity in the hill to sitt, and read or
contemplate. The workman had not workt an
hower before he discovers not only a rock, but
a rock of an unusuall figure with pendants
like icecles as at Wokey hole (Somerset), which
was the occasion of making that delicate grotto
and those fine walkes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[XXX.]</span></a>  &lt;Jack
Sydenham&gt; lived
before with Sir
Charles Snell at
Kington St.
Michaell. He
was wont to
carry me in his
armes: a gracefull
servant. He
gave me this
account.</p></div>

<p>Here in fine weather he would walke all night. Jack
Sydenham sang rarely: so did his other servant, Mr. Batty.
They went very gent. in cloathes, and he loved them as
his children.</p>

<p>He did not encumber him selfe with his wife, but here
enjoyed himselfe thus in this paradise till the war brake
out, and then retired to Lundy isle.</p>

<p>He had donne something (I have forgott what) that made
him obnoxious to the Parliament or Oliver Cromwell, about
1650; would have been hangd if taken; printed severall
letters to the Parliament, etc., dated from beyond sea, and
all that time lay privately in his howse in Lambeth marsh
where the<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> pointed pyramis is. In the garret there, is
a long gallery, which he hung all with<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> black, and had
some death's heads and bones painted. At the end where
his couch was, was in an old Gothique nich (like an old
monument) painted a skeleton incumbent<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> on a matt. At
the other end where was his pallet-bed was an emaciated
dead man stretched out. Here he had severall mortifying
and divine motto's (he imitated his lord<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> as much as he
could), and out of his windowes a very pleasant prospect.
At night he walkt in the garden and orchard. Only Mr.
Sydenham, and an old trusty woman, was privy to his
being in England.</p>

<p>He dyed about 1676 or 1677&mdash;quaere where&mdash;he was
80 yeares of age. [He<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> dyed in Scotland yard neer

was in anno 163&lt;6, 23 August&gt;. Insert, i.e. sowe<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> my

sang the songs (&lt;I&gt; now forgett his name).</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>Mr. Bushell had a daughter maried to a merchant ...
in Bristowe.</p>

<p>He was a handsome proper gentleman when I sawe him
at his house aforesayd at Lambith. He was about 70
but I should have not guessed him hardly 60. He had
a perfect healthy constitution; fresh, ruddy face; hawke-nosed,
and was temperate.</p>

<p>As he had the art of running in dept, so sometimes he
was attacqued and throwen into prison; but he would
extricate him selfe again straingely.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> died about 3 yeares since (&lt;from&gt; Sir William

his bed had black curtaines, etc., but it had no
bed-postes but hung by 4 cordes (covered with black-bayes)
instead of bed postes. When the queen-mother
came to Oxon to the king, she either brought (as I thinke)
or somebody gave her an entire mummie from Egypt,
a great raritie, which her majestie gave to Mr. Bushell, but
I beleeve long ere this time the dampnesse of the place haz
spoyled it with mouldinesse.</p>

and hard by, stood (1643, Aug. 8) a Neptune, neatly cutt
in wood, holding his trident in his hand, and ayming with
it at a duck which perpetually turned round with him, and
a spanniel swimming after her&mdash;which was very pretty, but
long since spoyled. I heare that ... earl of Rochester,
in whose possession it now is, doeth keepe it very well in
order.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>Mr. Bushell was the greatest arts-master to runne in
dept (perhaps) in the world. He died one hundred and
twenty thousand pounds in dept. He had so delicate a way
of making his projects alluring and feazible, profitable, that
he drewe to his baites not only rich men of no designe, but
also the craftiest knaves in the countrey, such who had
cosened and undon others: e.g. Mr. Goodyeere, who undid
Mr. Nicholas Mees's father, etc.</p>

&frac12; a mile from

<p>He went to schoole at Worcester&mdash;from
Mr. Hill.</p>

<p>His father &lt;was&gt; a man but of slender
fortune, and to breed him at schoole was as
much education as he was able to reach to.
When<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> but a boy he would make observations and reflections
on every thing one sayd or did, and censure it to be
either well or ill. He never was at the university, for
the reason alledged.</p>

<p>He came when a young man to be a servant to the
countesse of Kent, whom he served severall yeares. Here,
besides his study, he employed his time much in painting
and drawing, and also in musique. He was thinking once
to have made painting his profession&mdash;from Dr. Duke.
His love to and skill in painting made a great friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>between him and Mr. Samuel Cowper (the prince of limners
of this age).</p>

<p>He then studyed the Common Lawes of England, but
did not practise. He maried a good jointuresse, the relict
of ... Morgan, by which meanes he lives comfortably.</p>

<p>After the restauration of his majestie when the court at
Ludlowe was againe sett-up, he was then the king's steward
at the castle there.</p>

<p>He printed a witty Poeme called <i>Hudibras</i>, the first part
anno 166.. which tooke extremely<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>; so that the king and
Lord Chancellor Hyde<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[XXXIII.]</a> would have him
sent for, and accordingly he was sent for.
They both promised him great matters, but
to this day he haz got <i>no</i> employment, only
the king gave him ... <i>li.</i></p>

<p>He is of a middle stature, strong sett, high coloured,
a head of sorrell haire, a severe and sound judgement:
a good fellowe. He haz often sayd that way (e.g. Mr.
Edmund Waller's) of quibling with sence will hereafter

<h3><b>William Butler</b> (1535-1617/8).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>...<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Butler, physitian; he was of Clare-hall in
Cambridge, never tooke the degree of Doctor, though he
was the greatest physitian of his time.</p>

<p>The occasion of his being first taken notice of
was thus<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[XXXIV.]</a>:&mdash;About the comeing-in of<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> king
James, there was a minister of ... (a few miles
from Cambridge), that was to preach before
his majestie at New-market. The parson heard that
the king was a great scholar, and studyed so excessively
that he could not sleep, so somebody gave
him some opium, which had made him sleep his last,
had not Dr. Butler<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> used this following remedy. He
was sent for by the parson's wife. When he came and
sawe the parson, and asked what they had donne, he
told her that she was in danger to be hanged for killing
her husband, and so in great choler left her. It was at
that time when the cowes came into the backside to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>milk't. He turnes back, and asked whose cowes those
were. She sayd &lt;her&gt; husband's<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. Sayd he, 'will you
give one of these cowes to fetch your husband to life
again?' That she would, with all her heart. He then
causes one presently to be killed and opened, and the
parson<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[XXXV.]</a> to be taken out of his bed and putt
into the cowes warme belly, which after some
time brought him to life, or els he had
infallibly dyed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100"><span class="label">[XXXIV.]</span></a> From Edmund
Waller, esqre.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101"><span class="label">[XXXV.]</span></a> Quaere<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
E. W. or Gale,
who?</p></div>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;there is a parallell storie to this in
Machiavell's Florentiac History, where 'tis sayd that one
of the Cosmo's being poysoned was putt into a mule's
belly, sowed up, with a place only for his head to come out.</p>

<p>He was a humorist<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. One time king James sent for
him to New-market, and when he was gon halfe way
&lt;he&gt; left the messenger and turned back; so then the
messenger made him ride before him.</p>

<p>I thinke he was never maried. He lived in an apothecary's
shop, in Cambridge, &lt;John&gt; Crane, to whom he left his
estate; and he in gratitude erected the monument<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> for him,
at his owne chardge, in the fashion<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> he used. He was not
greedy of money, except choice pieces of gold or rarities.</p>

<p>He would many times (I have heard say) sitt among the
boyes at St. Maries church in Cambridge ( &#9758; and just
so would the famous attorney-generall Noy, in Lincoln's
Inne, who had many such froliques and humours).</p>

<p>I remember Mr. Wodenoth, of King's College, told me,
that being sent for to ... ... he told him that his
disease was not to be found in Galen or Hippocrates,
but in Tullie's Epistles, <i>Cum non sis ubi fueris, non est cur
velis vivere</i>.</p>

<p>I thinke he left his estate to the apothecarie. He gave
to the chapell of Clare-hall, a bowle<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>, for the communion,
of gold (cost, I thinke, 2 or 300 <i>li.</i>), on which is engraved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>a pelican feeding her young with the bloud from her breast
(an embleme of the passion of Christ), no motto, for the
embleme explained it selfe.</p>

<p>He lies buried in the south side of St. Marie's chancell,
in Cambridge, wher is a decent monument, with his body
halfe way, and an inscription, which gett.</p>

<p>He was much addicted to his humours, and would suffer
persons of quality to wayte sometimes some houres at his
dore, with coaches, before he would recieve them. Once,
on the rode from Cambridge to London, he tooke a fancy
to a chamberlayn or tapster in his inne, and tooke him
with him, and made him his favourite, by whom only
accession was to be had to him, and thus enriched him.
Dr. Gale<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a>, of Paul's schoole, assures me that a French
man came one time from London to Cambridge, purposely
to see him, whom he made stay two howres for him in
his gallery, and then he came out to him in an old blew
gowne; the French gentleman makes him 2 or 3 very
lowe bowes downe to the ground; Dr. Butler whippes
his legge over his head, and away goes into his chamber,
and did not speake with him.</p>

<p>He kept an old mayd whose name was Nell. Dr. Butler
would many times goe to the taverne, but drinke by himselfe.
About 9 or 10 at night old Nell comes for him
with a candle and lanthorne, and sayes 'Come you home,
you drunken beast.' By and by Nell would stumble;
then her master calls her 'drunken beast'; and so they
did <i>drunken beast</i> one another all the way till they came
home.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>A serving man brought his master's water to doctor
Butler, being then in his studie (with turn'd barres) but
would not bee spoken with. After much fruitlesse importunity,
the man told the doctor he was resolved he should
see his master's water; he would not be turned away&mdash;threw
it on the Dr's. head. This humour pleased the
Dr. and he went to the gent. and cured him&mdash;&lt;from&gt;
Mr. R. Hooke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>A gent. lying a-dyeing, sent his servant with a horse
for the doctor. The horse being exceeding dry, ducks
downe his head strongly into the water, and plucks downe
the Dr. over his head, who was plunged in the water over
head and eares. The Dr. was madded, and would returne
home. The man swore he should not; drew his sword,
and gave him ever and anon (when he would returne)
a little prick, and so drove him before him&mdash;&lt;from&gt;
Mr. ... Godfrey.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>Some instances of Dr. Butler's cures:&mdash;from Mr. James
Bovey.&mdash;The Dr. lyeing at the Savoy in London, next the
water side, where was a balcony look't into the Thames,
a patient came to him that was grievously tormented with
an ague. The Dr. orders a boate to be in readinesse
under his windowe, and discoursed with the patient (a
gentleman) in the balcony, when on a signall given, 2 or 3
lusty fellowes came behind the gentleman and threw him
a matter of 20 feete into the Thames. This surprize
absolutely cured him.</p>

<p>A gentleman with a red, ugly, pumpled face came to
him for a cure. Said the Dr., '<i>I must hang you</i>.' So
presently he had a device made ready to hang him from
a beame in the roome; and when he was e'en almost dead,
he cutts the veines that fed these pumples, and lett-out the
black ugly bloud, and cured him.</p>

<p>Another time one came to him for the cure of a cancer
(or ulcer) in the bowells. Said the Dr., 'can ye&mdash;&mdash;?'
'Yes,' said the patient. So the Dr. ordered a bason for
him to&mdash;&mdash;, and when he had so donne the Dr. commanded
him to eate it up. This did the cure.</p>

<h3><b>William Camden</b> (1551-1623).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>Mr. William Camden, Clarencieux&mdash;vide Fuller's <i>Holy
State</i> where is something of his life and birth, etc.: vide
<i>England's Worthies</i>: quaere at the Heralds' Office when
he was made Clarencieux.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Bagshawe (who had been second schoole-master
of Westminster schoole) haz told me that Mr. Camden
had first his place and his lodgeings (which is the gate-house
by the Queen's Scholars' chamber in Deanes-yard),
and was after made the head schoole-master of that
schoole, where he writt and taught <i>Institutio Gr&aelig;cae
Grammatices Compendiaria: in usum Regiae Scholae
Westmonasteriensis</i>, which is now the common Greeke
grammar of England, but his name is not sett to it.
Before, they learned the prolix Greeke Grammar of
Cleonard.</p>

<p>He writt his <i>Britannia</i> first in a large 8&ordm;.</p>

<p><i>Annales reg. Elizabethae.</i></p>

<p>There is a little booke in 16mo. of his printed, viz.:
A Collection of all the Inscriptions then on the Tombes
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>'Tis reported, that he had bad eies<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> (I guesse lippitude)
which was a great inconvenience to an antiquary.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholas Mercator has Stadius's <i>Ephemerides</i>, which
had been one of Mr. Camden's; his name is there (I knowe
his hand) and there are some notes by which I find he was
astrologically given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>In his <i>Britannia</i> he haz a remarkable astrologicall
observation, that when Saturn is in Capricornus a great
plague is certainly in London. He had observed it all his
time, and setts downe the like made by others before
his time. Saturn was so posited in the great plague 1625,
and also in the last great plague 1665. He likewise
delivers that when an eclipse happens in ... that
'tis fatall to the towne of Shrewsbury, for....</p>

<p>He was basted by a courtier of the queene's in the
cloysters at Westminster for ... queen Elizabeth in his
history&mdash;from Dr. John Earle, dean of Westminster.</p>

<p>My honoured and learned friend, Thomas Fludd, esq.,
a Kentish gentleman, (&lt;aged&gt; 75, 1680) was neighbour
and an acquaintance to Sir Robert Filmore, in Kent,
who was very intimately acquainted with Mr. Camden,
who told Sir Robert that he was not suffered to print
many things in his <i>Elizabetha</i>, which he sent over to
his acquaintance and correspondent Thuanus, who printed
it all faithfully in his <i>Annalls</i> without altering a word&mdash;quod
N. B.</p>

<p>He lies buried in the South cross-aisle of Westminster
Abbey, his effigies &frac12; on an altar, with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<h3><b>William Canynges</b> (1399-1474).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>The antiquities of the city of Bristowe doe very
well deserve some antiquarie's paines (and the like for
Gloucester). Here were a great many religious houses. The
collegiate church (priorie of Augustines) is very good building,
especially the gate-house. The best built churches
of any city in England, before these new ones at London
since the conflagration. Severall monuments and inscriptions.</p>

<p>Ratliff church (which was intended<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> for a chapel) is
an admirable piece of architecture of about Henry VII's
time. It was built by alderman ... Canning, who had
fifteen shippes of his owne (or 16). He gott his estate
chiefly by carrying of pilgrims to St. Jago of Compostella.
He had a fair house in Ratliff Street that lookes towards
the water side, ancient Gothique building, a large house
that, 1656, was converted to a glasse-house. See the annotations
on Norton's Ordinall in <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, where
'tis sayd that Thomas Norton of Bristow got the secret
of the philosopher's stone from alderman Canning's widow.</p>

<p>This alderman Canning did also build and well endow
the religious house at Westbury or Henbury (vide Speede's
mappe and chronicle); 'tis about two or three miles from
Bristowe in the rode to Aust-passage.</p>

<p>In his old age he retired to this house and entred into
that order. He built his owne monument at his church at
Ratcliff where is an inscription, which gett<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a>; &#9758; but he

particularly the sermon that by the king's command he
preached at his returne from Edge-hill fight.</p>

which his son has now (but having many children, lives
not handsomely and haz lost his learning: he was by

<h3><b>Lucius Cary</b>, viscount Falkland (1610-1643).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>Lucius Carey<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a>, second lord Falkland, was the eldest
son of Sir Henry Carey, Lord Lievetenant of Ireland, the
first viscount Falkland.</p>

<p>His mother was daughter and heir of Sir &lt;Laurence&gt;
Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, by whom
he had Great Tue, in Oxfordshire (formerly the Rainesfords),
and the Priory of Burford, in Oxfordshire, which
he sold to &lt;William&gt; Lenthall, the Speaker of the Long
Parliament.</p>

<p>He was borne ... (quaere); had his University education
at the University of Dublin, in Ireland. He travelled,
and had one Mr. ... (a very discreet gentleman) to be
his governor<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a>, whom he respected to his dyeing day.</p>

<p>He maried Letice, the daughter of Sir &lt;Richard&gt;
Morison, by whom he had two sonnes: the eldest lived
to be a man, died <i>sine prole</i>; the second was father to
this lord Falkland now living.</p>

<p>This lady Letice was a good and pious lady, as you
may see by her life writt about 1649, or 50, by ...
Duncomb, D.D. But I will tell you a pretty story from
William Hawes, of Trin. Coll., who was well acquainted
with the governor aforesaid, who told him that my lady
was (after the manner of woemen) much governed by,
and indulgent to, the nursery; when she had a mind to
beg any thing of my lord for one of her woemen<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> (nurses,
or &amp;c.); she would not doe it by herselfe (if she could
helpe it), but putt this gentleman upon it, to move it to
my lord. My lord had but a small estate for his title;
and the old gentleman would say, 'Madam, this is so
unreasonable a motion to propose to my lord, that I am
certaine he will never graunt it';&mdash;e.g. one time to lett
a farme<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> twenty pound per annum under value. At
length, when she could not prevaile on him, she would
say that, 'I warrant you, for all this, I will obtaine it of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>my lord; <i>it will cost me but the expence of a few teares</i>.'
Now she would make her words good; and this great
witt, the greatest master of reason and judgement of his
time, at the long runne, being storm'd by her <i>teares</i> (I presume
there were kisses and secret embraces that were also
ingredients), would this pious lady obtain her unreasonable
desires of her poor lord.</p>

<p>N.B.:&mdash;my lord in his youth was very wild, and also
mischievous, as being apt to stabbe and doe bloudy mischiefs;
but 'twas not long before he tooke-up to be
serious, and then grew to be an extraordinary hard
student. I have heard Dr. Ralph Bathurst<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[XXXVIII.]</a>
say that, when he was a boy, my lord lived
at Coventrey (where he had then a house),
and that he would sett up very late at nights
at his study, and many times came to the
library at the schoole<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[XXXIX.]</a> there.</p>

<p>The studies in fashion in those dayes (in
England) were poetry, and controversie with
the church of Rome. My lord's mother was a zealous
papist, who being very earnest to have her son of her
religion, and her son upon that occasion, labouring hard
to find the<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>trueth, was so far at last from setling
on the Romish church, that he setled and rested in
the Polish (I meane Socinianisme). He was the first
Socinian in England; and Dr. &lt;Hugh&gt; Crescy, of Merton
Coll. (dean of &lt;Leighlin&gt; in Ireland, afterwards a Benedictin
monke), a great acquaintance of my lord's in those
dayes (anno ...), told me, at Samuel Cowper's (1669),
that he himselfe was the first that brought Socinus's bookes
(anno ...); shortly after, my lord comeing to him, and
casting his eie on them, would needs presently borrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
them, to peruse; and was so extremely taken and satisfied
with them, that from that time was his conversion.</p>

<p>My lord much lived at Tue, which is a pleasant seat,
and about 12 miles from Oxford; his lordship was acquainted
with the best witts of that University, and his
house was like a Colledge, full of learned men<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. Mr.
William Chillingworth, of Trinity College in Oxford (afterwards
D.D.), was his most intimate and beloved favourite,
and was most commonly with my lord; next I may reckon
(if not equall) Mr. John Earles, of Merton College (who
wrote the Characters); Dr. &lt;George&gt; Eglionby, of Ch. Ch.,
was also much in esteem with his lordship. His chaplaine,
Charles Gataker, (filius &lt;Thomae&gt; Gataker of Redriff, a
writer), was an ingeniose young gentleman, but no writer<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.
For learned gentlemen of the country, his acquaintance
was Sir H. Rainesford, of ... neer Stratford-upon-Avon,
now ... (quaere Tom Mariet); Sir Francis Wenman<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>,
of Caswell, in Witney parish; Mr. ... Sandys, the traveller
and translator (who was uncle to my lady Wenman);
Ben. Johnson (vide Johnsonus Virbius, where he haz
verses, and 'twas his lordship, Charles Gattaker told
me, that gave the name to it); Edmund Waller, esq.;
Mr. Thomas Hobbes, and all the excellent<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> of that
peaceable time.</p>

<p>In the civill warres he adhered to King Charles I, who
after Edge-hill fight made him Principall Secretary of
Estate (with Sir Edward Nicholas), which he dischardged
with a great deale of witt and prudence, only his advice
was very unlucky to his Majestie, in perswading him
(after the victory<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> at Rowndway-downe, and the taking
of Bristowe), to sitt-downe before Glocester, which was
so bravely defended by that incomparably vigilant governor
coll.... Massey, and the diligent and careful soldiers,
and citizens (men and woemen), that it so broke and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>weakned the king's army, that 'twas the procatractique
cause of his ruine: vide Mr. Hobbes. After this, all
the King's matters went worse and worse. Anno domini
164&lt;3&gt; at the ... fight (quaere which) at Newbery, my
lord Falkland being there, and having nothing to doe to
chardge; as the 2 armies were engageing, rode in like
a mad-man (as he was) between them, and was (as he
needs must be) shott. Some that<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> were your superfine
discoursing politicians and fine gentlemen, would needs
have the reason of this mad action of throwing away
his life so, to be his discontent for the unfortunate advice
given to his master as aforesaid; but, I have been
well enformed, by those that best knew him, and<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
knew the intrigues behind the curtaine (as they say),
that it was the griefe of the death of Mris ... Moray,
a handsome lady at court, who was his mistresse, and
whom he loved above all creatures, was the true cause
of his being so madly guilty of his own death, as afore
mentioned: (<i>nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae</i>).</p>

<p>The next day, when they went to bury the dead, they
could not find his lordship's body, it was stript, trod-upon,
and mangled; so there was one that had wayted on him
in his chamber would undertake to know it from all other
bodyes, by a certaine mole his lordship had in his neck,
and by that marke did find it. He lies interred in the ...
at Great Tue aforesaid, but, I thinke, yet without
any monument; quaere if any inscription.</p>

<p>In the dining roome there is a picture of his at length,
and like him ('twas donne by Jacob de Valke, who taught
me to paint). He was but a little man, and of no great
strength of body; he had blackish haire, something flaggy,
and I thinke his eies black. Dr. Earles would not allow
him to be a good poet, though a great witt; he writt
not a smoth verse, but a greate deal of sense. He hath
writt....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>He had an estate in Hertfordshire, at ..., which
came by Morrison (as I take it); sold not long before
the late civill warres.</p>

Cavendish<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> was borne at ..., the younger brother to
William, duke of Newcastle. He was a little, weake,
crooked man, and nature having not adapted him for
the court nor campe, he betooke himselfe to the study
of the mathematiques, wherin he became a great master.
His father left him a good estate, the revenue wherof he
expended on bookes and on learned men.</p>

<p>He had collected in Italie, France, &amp;c., with no small
chardge, as many manuscript mathematicall bookes as
filled a hoggeshead, which he intended to have printed;
which if he had live&lt;d&gt; to have donne, the growth of
mathematicall learning had been 30 yeares or more forwarder
then 'tis. But he died of the scurvey, contracted
by hard study, about 1652 (quaere), and left one Mr. ...,
an attorney of Clifford's Inne, his executor, who
shortly after died, and left his wife executrix, who sold
this incomparable collection aforesaid by weight to the
past-board makers for wast paper. &#9758; A good caution
for those that have good MSS. to take care to see them
printed in their life-times.</p>

<p>He dyed ... and was buried in the vault of the
family of the duke of Newcastle, at Bolsover, in the
countie of &lt;Derby&gt;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

right honourable &lt;William, 2nd&gt; earle of Devonshire,
brother to this present earle, William.</p>

<p>He was borne at ... anno.... He was well
educated, and then travelled into France, Italie, &amp;c.; but
was so extremely delighted in travelling, that he went
into Greece, all over; and that would not serve his turne
but he would goe to Babylon, and then his governour
would not adventure to goe any further with him; but to
see Babylon he was to march in the Turks' armie. This
account I had many yeares since, scilicet 1642, from my
cosen Edmund Lyte, who was then gentleman usher to
his mother the countesse dowager.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me that this Mr. Cavendish told
him that the Greekes doe sing their Greeke.&mdash;In Herefordshire
they have a touch of this singing; our old divines
had. Our old vicar of Kington St. Michael, Mr. Hynd,
did sing his sermons rather then reade them. You may
find in Erasmus that the monkes used this fashion, who
mocks them, that sometimes they would be very lowe,
and by and by they would be mighty high, <i>quando nihil
opus est</i>.&mdash;Anno 1660 comeing one morning to Mr. Hobbes,
his Greeke Xenophon lay open on the board: sayd he,
'Had you come but a little sooner you had found a Greeke
here that came to see me, who understands the old Greeke;
I spake to him to read here in this booke, and he sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
it; which putt me in mind of what Mr. Charles Cavendish
told me' (as before); 'the first word is &#7964;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;, he pronounced
it <i>e&#787;&#769;nnia</i>.' The better way to explaine it is by

which consisted of 24 troupes of horse and dragoons. Against this
force, col. Cavendish having the command of 30 troupes of horse and
dragoons, drawes out 16 only, and leaving all the rest for a reserve,
advanced towards them, and engaged himselfe with this small partie
against all their strength. Which being observed by the rebells, they
gott between him and his reserve, routed his 16 troupes, being forespent
with often watches, killed lievetenant-colonel Markam, most
valiantly fighting in defence of his king and countrey. The most noble
and gallant colonel himselfe, whilest he omitted no part of a brave
commander, being cutt most dangerously in the head, was struck-off
his horse, and so unfortunately shott with a brace of bullets after
he was on the ground, whose life was most pretious to all noble and
valiant gentlemen. Wherupon the reserve coming, routed and cutt
downe the partie.'</p></div>

<p>This was donne either the 28 or 29 of July, 1643, for
upon this terrible rout, the lord Willoughby of Parham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
forthwith yealded Gainsborough to the king's partie,
July 30; the earle of Newcastle being then generall of
that partie.</p>

<p>His body was first buried at ...,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[XL.]</a> but
by order of his mother's will, when she was
buried at Darby (where she has erected a
noble monument for herselfe and lord) she
ordered her sonne's body to be removed, and both to
be layd in the vault there together, which was Feb. 18,
1674.</p>

<p>Funerall Sermon, by William Naylour, her chaplain,
preached at Darby, Feb. 18, 1674. Lond. for Henry
Broome. Texte, 2 Sam. iii. 38th verse.&mdash;page 16:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'He was the souldiers' mignion, and his majestie's darling, designed
by him generall of the northern horse (and his commission was given
him), a great marke of honour for one of about five and twenty:
"thus shall it be donne to the man whom the king delights to
honour."</p>

<p>'Col. Cavendish was a princely person, and all his actions were
agreable to that character: he had in an eminent degree that which
the Greekes call &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#958;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#8055;&#948;&#959;&#962;, the semblance and appearance
of a man made to governe. Methinkes he gave cleare this indication,
the king's cause lived with him, the king's cause died with him&mdash;when
Cromwell heard that he was slaine, he cried upon it <i>We have donne
our businesse</i>.</p>

<p>'And yet two things (I must confess) this commander knew not,
pardon his ignorance,&mdash;he knew not to flie away&mdash;he knew not how to
aske quarter&mdash;though an older did, I meane ... Henderson; for when
this bold person entred Grantham on the one side, that wary gentleman,
who should have attaqued it, fled away on the other. If Cato
thought it usurpation in Caesar to give him his life, Cavendish thought
it a greater for traytors and rebells of a common size to give him his.
This brave hero might be opprest, (as he was at last by numbers) but
he could not be conquered; the dying words of Epaminondas will fitt
him, <i>Satis vixi, invictus etiam morior</i>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>'What wonders might have been expected from a commander
so vigilant, so loyall, so constant, had he not dropt downe in his
blooming age? But though he fell in his green yeares, he<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> fell a
prince, and a great one too, in this respect greater then Abner; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Abner, that son of Mars, deserved his father's epithite, &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;,
<i>one of both sides</i>, first he setts-up Isbosheth, and then deserts him.
Whereas Cavendish merited such a statue as the Roman senate
decreed L. Vitellius, and the same inscription, <i>Pietatis immobilis
erga Principem</i>, one whose loyaltie to his great master nothing
could shake.</p>

<p>'Secondly, consider the noble Charles Cavendish in his extraction,
and so he is a branch of that family, of which some
descended that are kings of Scotland: this the word
<i>Fuimus</i> joyned to his maternall<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[XLI.]</a> coate does plainly
point at&mdash;not to urge at this time his descent by the
father's side from one of the noblest families in England.
An high extraction to some persons is like the dropsie,
the greatnesse of the man is his disease, and renders
him unweildie; but here is a person of great extract
free from the swelling of greatness, as brisk and active
as the lightest horseman that fought under him. In
some parts of India, they tell us, that a nobleman
accounts himselfe polluted if a plebeian touch him;
but here is a person of that rank who used the same
familiaritie<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[XLII.]</a> and frankness amongst the meanest of his
souldiers, the poorest miner, and amongst his equalls;
and by stooping so low, he rose the higher in the
common account, and was valued accordingly as a
prince<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>, and a great one; thus Abner and Cavendish
run parallell in their titles and appellations.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115"><span class="label">[XLI.]</span></a> His mother
was daughter
to the lord
Bruce, whose
ancestors had
been kings of
Scotland.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[XLII.]</span></a> Sir Robert
Harley (son), an
ingeniose gent.
and expert soldier,
haz often
sayd, that
(generally) the
commanders of
the king's army
would never be
acquainted with
their soldiers,
which was an
extraordinary
prejudice to the
kings cause.
A captaine's
good look, or
good word (some
times), does
infinitely winne
them, and
oblige them;
and he would
say 'twas to
admiration how
souldiers will
venture their
lives for an
obligeing officer.&mdash;quod
N. B.</p></div>

<p>'Consider Abner in the manner of his fall, that was
by a treacherous hand, and so fell Cavendish. II Sam.
iii. 27, "and when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab
tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him quietly,
and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died,
for the bloud of Asahel<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> his brother." Thus fell Abner; and thus
Cavendish,&mdash;the colonell's horse being mired in a bog at the fight
before Gainsborough, 1643, the rebels surround him, and take him
prisoner; and after he was so, a base raskall comes behind him, and
runs him through. Thus fell two great men by treacherous handes.</p>

<p>'Thirdly and lastly, the place of his fall, that was in Israel.... Here
Abner fell in his, and Cavendish fell in our Israel&mdash;the Church of
England.... In this Church brave Cavendish fell, and what is more
then that, in this Churches quarrel....</p>

<p>'Thus I have compared colonel Cavendish with Abner, a fighting
and a famous man in Israel; you see how he does equal, how he does
exceed him.'</p></div>

<h3><b>Thomas Chaloner</b> (1595-1661).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>Thomas Chaloner<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a>, esq., [bred<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> up in Oxon], was the
&lt;third&gt; son of Dr &lt;Thomas&gt; Chaloner, who was tutor (i.e.
<i>informator</i><a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>) to prince Henry (or prince Charles&mdash;vide
bishop Hall's Letters de hoc).</p>

<p>He was a well-bred gentleman, and of very good naturall
parts, and of an agreable humour. He had the accomplishments
of studies at home, and travells in France, Italie,
and Germanie.</p>

<p>About anno ... (quaere John Collins) riding a hunting
in Yorkeshire (where the allum workes now are), on
a common, he<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a> tooke notice of the soyle and herbage, and
tasted the water, and found it to be like that where he
had seen the allum workes in Germanie. Wherupon he
gott a patent of the king (Charles I) for an allum worke
(which was the first that ever was in England), which was
worth to him two thousand pounds per annum, or better:
but tempore Caroli I<sup>mi</sup> some courtiers did thinke the
profitt too much for him, and prevailed so with the king,
that, notwithstanding the patent aforesayd, he graunted
a moeitie, or more, to another (a courtier), which was the
reason that made Mr. Chaloner so interest himselfe for
the Parliament-cause, and, in revenge, to be one of the
king's judges.</p>

<p>He was as far from a puritan as the East from the
West. He was of the naturall religion, and of Henry
Martyn's gang, and one who loved to enjoy the pleasures
of this life. He was (they say) a good scholar, but he
wrote nothing that I heare of, onely an anonymous pamphlett,
8vo, scil. <i>An account of the Discovery of Moyses's
Tombe</i>; which was written very wittily. It was about
1652. It did sett the witts of all the Rabbis of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Assembly then to worke, and 'twas a pretty while before
the shamme was detected, which was by &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>He had a trick sometimes to goe into Westminster hall
in a morning in Terme time, and tell some strange story<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
(sham), and would come thither again about 11 or 12
to have the pleasure to heare how it spred; and sometimes
it would be altered, with additions, he could scarce knowe
it to be his owne. He was neither proud nor covetous,
nor a hypocrite: not apt to doe injustice, but apt to
revenge.</p>

<p>After the restauration of King Charles the Second, he<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a>
kept the castle at the Isle of Man<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[XLIII.]</a>, where he
had a prettie wench that was his concubine;<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
where when newes was brought him that there
were some come to the castle to demaund it
for his majestie, he spake to his girle to make
him a posset, into which he putt, out of a paper
he had, some poyson, which did, in a very short
time, make him fall a vomiting exceedingly;
and after some time vomited nothing but bloud.
His retchings were so violent that the standers
by were much grieved to behold it. Within
three howres he dyed. The demandants of the
castle came and sawe him dead; he was swoln
so extremely that they could not see any eie he had, and
no more of his nose then the tip of it, which shewed like
a wart, and his coddes were swoln as big as one's head.
This account I had from George Estcourt, D.D., whose
brother-in-lawe, ... Hotham, was one of those that sawe
him.</p>

<h4><a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[621]</a><i>Concerning Mr. Charnocke.</i></h4>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Wells of Bridgewater performed his promise. He
writes that the house was lately pulled down, and is new
built from the ground, all except the wall at the east end.
He could make nothing of what was only left over the
chimney; but he found the little dore that led out of the
lodging-chamber into the little <i>Athanor</i> roome. Of that
you have an account in the enclosed draught.</p>

<p>The two roses I take to be the white and red, termes
common with Charnocke for the two magisteries. The
two animals over them I suppose are wolves, denoting
the<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> &#9793;; abounding with a volatile<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> &#9737; and used for preparing
and purifying one of the principal ingredients into
the worke. Out of it growes (if those authors may be
credited) most precious fruits.</p>

<p>I obliged a painter to goe over soon after I had been
there and take all he could find exactly. He was there,
but I could never get anything from him: an ingeniose
man, but egregiously carelesse.</p>

<p>Looking back I find this noted by me&mdash;June 22, 1681;
the place in the <i>Athanor</i> roome in which he kept his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>lampe was stone-work about 15 inches deep and so much
square in the clear from side to side. Over it a wooden
collar with a rabit<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> as to lett-in a cover close. No place
to come into the square but by the collar, contrived probably
after the accident of burning his tabernacle mentioned in
his printed pieces.</p>

<p>I find this added:&mdash;'Twas painted about the chimney
thus:&mdash;on the left side of the chimney proceeded from
a red stalk streaked with white, first, a paire of red branches,
then a paire of white, then of red, then one of white to
the top; something like a rabbit's head painted looking
from the chimney to the foot of the sayd stalk.&mdash;The next
picture separated as by a pillar on the chimney:&mdash;from
one stalke, two white branches, of either side one; then
two red, above; then two white; then at the top this

<img src="images/i_p163.png" width="36" height="64" alt="" />, the balls of a dusky yellow.&mdash;The next picture is
also distinguished by a pillar on the chimney to the

<p>
<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I received and returne thankes for yours.</p>

<p>Since my last I got leave to transcribe what Mr. Charnocke
wrote on the backside of the rolle, which I heer
send you. I kept as neare as I could to the very errours
of his pen, by which it may in part be seen that he was,
as he professes, an <i>unlettered</i> scholar. The inside of the rolle
(which is all in Latine, and perhaps the same with the
scrowle mentioned in <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, p. 375) was
composed by a great master in the Hermetic philosophy
and written by a master of his pen. Some notes written
in void spaces of it by Mr. Charnocke's hand shew he did
not (at least throughly) understand it. But it seemes to
me that this rolle was a kind of <i>Vade mecum</i> or manuall
that the students in that wisdome carryed about with
them. I presume 'twas drawn out of Raymund Lully, of
which I shall be able to gaine fuller satisfaction when
I have his workes come down.</p>

<p>I was also, since my last, at Mr. Charnocke's house in
Comag, where the rolle was found; and saw the place
where 'twas hid. I saw the litle roome and contrivance
he had for keeping his worke, and found it ingeniosely
ordered so as to prevent a like accident to that which
befell him New Yeare's day, 1555; and this pretty place
joining as a closet to his chamber was to make a servant
needlesse and the worke of giving attendance more easy
to himselfe. I have also a litle iron instrument found
there which he made use of about his fire. I sawe on the
doore of his little <i>Athanor</i>-room, if I may so call it, drawn
by his own hand, with course colours and work, but ingeniously,
an embleme of his worke, at which I gave some
guesses, and so about the walls of his chamber. I thinke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>there was in all 5 panes of this worke, all somewhat differing
from each other, some very obscure and almost worne out.
They told me that people had been unwilling to dwell in
that house, because reputed troublesome,&mdash;I presume from
some traditionall storyes of this person, who was looked
on by his neighbours as no better than a conjurer.</p>

<p>As I was taking horse to come home from this pleasant
entertainment, I see a pretty ancient man come forth of
the next doore. I asked him how long he had lived there.
Finding that it was the place of his birth, I inquired if he
had ever heard anything of that Mr. Charnocke. He told
me he had heard his mother (who dyed about 12 or 14
yeares since and was 80 yeares of age at her decease) often
speake of him; that he kept a fire in, divers yeares; that
his daughter lived with him; that once he was gone forth,
and by her neglect (whome he trusted it with in his
absence) the fire went out and so all his worke was lost;
the brazen head was very neare comeing to speake, but
so was he disappointed.</p>

<p>I suppose the pleasant-humoured man&mdash;for that he was
so appeares by his breviary&mdash;alludeing to Frier Bacon's
story, did so put off the inquisitivenes of his simple neighbours,
and thence it is come down there by tradition
till now.</p>

<p>Indeed it appeares by the inclosed lines that when he
wrote the rolle he had attained but to the white stone,
which is perhaps not half the way to the red,</p>

<p>('Put me to my sister Mercury, I congeale into silver');
and, if the old woman's tale were true, he might afterwards
be going on and be come neare to the red and then
that vexing accident might befall him; and this might
be, notwithstanding what is sayd in the fragment, referred
to the yeare 1574, for (being so neare the red
as the traditionall story sayes he was) he might see
in that 50th yeare of his age that the white was ferment
to the red.</p>

<p>You may observe my calculation differs in one thing
from Mr. Ashmole's in his notes upon <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
p. 478: for he makes 'the presse' to have been (out of
Stowe) 1558, but I (out of Dr. Burnet's History) 1557;
and consequently he supposes the presse to have been
after the finishing of the Breviary, but I presume he set
on the Breviary after he was pressed. So indeed he himselfe
plainly averres in the 4 last lines of chapter 4 of his
Breviary (<i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, p. 296). I mention this
to give a reason for my dissenting from your worthy friend,
to whome I must intreat you to communicate these informations
that I have had opportunity to gather, and
also present my humble service.</p>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I thought when I set pen to paper to have given
you an account of some conversation I have had with a person
who is a zealous friend and admirer of this sort of knowledge,
but I see I have already gone beyound bounds.
I shal onely say he hath almost convinced me that it is
not so hidden and obscure, so difficult and unaccountable,
as men commonly seeme to beleeve. I am in hopes to
receive, by Mr. Hooke's and Mr. Lodwick's favour, the
lamp for which he was pleased to give directions some
time since.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen my miller and his invention, though he
promised to bring it to me; I presume 'tis not yet ready.
I expect him dayly.</p>

<p>Pray give my humble service to our worthy friend, and
to Mr. Pigott.</p>

<p>My tutor, W. Browne<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a>, haz told me, that Dr. Chillingworth
studied not much, but when he did, he did much in
a little time. He much delighted in Sextus Empeiricus.
He did walke much in the College grove, and there
contemplate, and meet with some <i>cod's-head</i> or other, and
dispute with him and baffle him. He thus prepared
himselfe before-hand. He would alwayes be disputing;
so would my tutor. I thinke it was an epidemick evill
of that time, which I think now is growne out of fashion,
as unmannerly and boyish. He was the readiest and
nimblest disputant of his time in the university, perhaps
none haz equalled him since.</p>

Potter and Dr. Roberts. Dr. Han. Potter had been
formerly chaplain to the bishop of Winton, who was so
much Dr. Potter's friend, that though (as Will Hawes haz
told me) Dr. Potter was not lawfully elected, upon
referring themselves to their visitor (bishop of Winton),
the bishop (Curle) ordered Dr. Potter possession; and
let the fellowes gett him out if they could. This was
shortly after the lord Falkland was slaine, who had he
lived, Dr. Chillingworth assured Will Hawes, no man
should have carried it against him: and that he was so
extremely discomposed and wept bitterly for the losse
of his deare friend, yet notwithstanding he doubted not
to have an astergance<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[CH]</a> for it.</p>

countesse of

<p>The best account of his expedition with his fleet to
America is to be found in Purchas's <i>Pilgrim</i>. He tooke
from the Spaniards to the value of seaven or 8 hundred
thousand poundes. When he returned with this riche
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>cargo (the richest without doubt that ever subject brought),
the queene's councell (where he had some that envyed
him&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Virtutis comes Invidia</i>)</p>

<p>layed their heads together and concluded 'twas too much
for a subject to have, and confiscated it all to the queen,
even shippes and all, and to make restauration to the
Spaniard, that he was forced to sell fifteene thousand
pounds per annum. My lady Thanet told me she sawe
the accounts in writing. The armada of the Argonautes
was but a trifle to this.</p>

<p>As I take it, Sir Walter Ralegh went this brave voyage
with his lordship; and Mr. Edmund Wright, the excellent
navigator; and, not unlikely, Mr. Harriot too.</p>

<p>This was the breaking of that ancient and noble family;
but Robert, earl of Salisbury (who was the chiefest enemie)
afterwards maried his daughter, as above, as he might
well be touch't in conscience, to make some recompence
after he had donne so much mischiefe.</p>

<p>That he was an acquaintance of Sir Walter Raleigh,
I remember by this token, that Sir James Long told me
that one time he came to Draycot with Sir Walter Raleigh
from Bathe, and, hunting a buck in the parke there, his
horse made a false step in a conie-borough and threw him
and brake the kennell-bone of his shoulder.</p>

<h3><b>Sir Edward Coke</b> (1551/2-1633).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>Vide his life by ...: quaere his nephew or sonne<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> Roger
Coke. Sir Edward Coke<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[CK]</a>, knight, Lord Chiefe Justice of
the King's Bench, was borne at ... in Norfolke. I heard
an old lawyer ( ... Dunstable) of the Middle Temple,
1646, who was his country-man, say that he was borne to
300 <i>li.</i> land per annum<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a>, and I have heard some of his
country say again that he was borne but to 40 <i>li.</i> per
annum. What shall one beleeve?</p>

<p>Quaere Roger Coke of what house he was in Cambridge,
or if ever at the University.</p>

<p>Old John Tussell (that was my attorney) haz told me
that he gott a hundred thousand pounds in one yeare, viz.
1&ordm; Jacobi, being then attorney-generall. His advice was
that every man of estate (right or wrong) should sue-out
his pardon, which cost 5 <i>li.</i> which<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> was his fee.</p>

<p>He left an estate of eleaven thousand pounds per annum.
Sir John Danvers<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a>, who knew him, told me that when one
told him his sonnes would spend the estate faster then he
gott it, he replyed 'they cannot take more delight in
spending of it then I did in the getting of it.'</p>

<p>He was chamber-fellow to the Lord Chiefe Baron Wyld's
father (Serjeant Wyld<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a>). He built the black buildings
at the Inner Temple (now burn't) which were above the
walke toward the west end, called then 'Coke's buildings.'</p>

<p>After he was putt out of his place of Lord Chief Justice
of the King's Bench<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>, to spite him, they made him sheriff
of Buckinghamshire, anno Dni ...; at which time he
caused the sheriff's oath to be altered, which till that time
was, amongst other things, to enquire after and apprehend
all Lollards. He was also chosen, after he was displaced,
a burghesse to sitt in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[XLVIII.]</a>He was of wonderfull painstaking, as appeares
by his writings. He was short-sighted
but never used spectacles to his dyeing day, being then 83
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>yeares of age. He was a very handsome proper man and
of a curious complexion, as appeares by his picture at
the Inner Temple, which his grandson gave them about
1668, at length, in his atturney-generall's fusted gowne,
which the house haz turned into judge's robes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_136" id="Footnote_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136"><span class="label">[XLVIII.]</span></a> From Roger
Coke.</p></div>

<p>He maried, his second wife, ..., the relickt of Sir ...
Hatton, who was with child when he maried her<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.&mdash;&lt;from&gt;
&lt;Elizabeth&gt; lady Purbec; vide B. Johnson's masque of
the Gipsies.</p>

<p>He dyed at Stoke-poges in com. Bucks ... 1638<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
(quaere), but is buryed at ... in Norfolk.</p>

<p>For his moralls, see <i>Sir W. Raleigh's Tryall</i>.</p>

<p>He shewed himselfe too clownish and bitter in his
carriage to Sir Walter Ralegh at his triall, where he sayes
'Thou traytor,' at every word, and 'thou lyest like a traytor.'
See it in Sir Walter Ralegh's life, Lond. 1678, 8vo.</p>

<p>He playes<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> with his case as a cat would with a mouse,
and be so fulsomely pedantique that a school boy would
nauseate it. But when he comes to matter of lawe, all
acknowledge him to be admirable. When Mr. Cuff<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>,
secretary to the earle of Essex, was arraigned, he would
dispute with him in syllogismes, till at last one of his
brethern said, 'Prithee, brother, leave off: thou doest
dispute scurvily.' Cuff was a smart man and a great
scholar and baffeld him. Said Cooke</p>

<p class="center">'Dominum cognoscite vestrum';</p>

<p>Cuff replied,'My lord, you leave out the former part of the
verse<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>, which you should have repeated,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Acteon</i> ego sum'&mdash;</p>

<p>reflecting on his being a cuckold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p><a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>The world expected from him a commentary on
Littleton's Tenures; and he left them his Common-place
book, which is now so much made use of.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke did envie<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Sir Francis Bacon, and
was wont to undervalue his lawe: vide de hoc in the lord
Bacon's lettres, where he expostulates this thing with Sir
Edward Coke, and tells him that he may grow when that
others doe stand at a stay.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he was of Clifford's Inne before he was
of the Inner Temple, as the fashion then was first to be of
an Inne of Chancery.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;when the play called <i>Ignoramus</i> (made
by one Ruggle of Clare-hall) was acted with great applause
before King James, they dressed Sir Ignoramus like Chief
Justice Coke and cutt his beard like him and feigned his
voyce. Mr. Peyton, our vicar of Chalke, was then a
scholar at Kings College and sawe it. This drollery did
ducere in seria mala: it sett all the lawyers against the
clergie, and shortly upon this Mr. Selden wrote of Tythes
not jure divino.</p>

<p>Cardinal Mezarin found that his stables were very chardgeable
to him, and was imposed upon in accompts. He
hearing of this merchant Colbert to be a great master
in this art, sends for him and desires him to make inspection
into his accounts and putt him into a better method to
avoyd being abused. Which he did, and that so well that
he imployed him in ordering the accounts of all his estate
and found him so usefull that he also made use of him to
methodize and settle the accompts of the king. This was
his rise.&mdash;From Dr. John Pell.</p>

for all that, that good man had so great a zeale for the

<p>He was a Westminster scholar; old parson Bussey, of
Alscott in Warwickshire, went to schoole with him&mdash;he
would say that he was a very handsome man, but something
apt to abuse, and a coward.</p>

<p>He was a student (vide Anthony Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>)
of Christ-church in Oxford. He was very facetious, and
a good fellowe. One time he and some of his acquaintance
being merry at Fryar Bacon's study (where was good liquor
sold), they were drinking on the leads of the house, and
one of the scholars was asleepe, and had a paire of good
silke stockings on. Dr. Corbet (then M.A., if not B.D.)
gott a paire of cizers and cutt them full of little holes, but
when the other awaked, and percieved how and by whom he
was abused, he did chastise him, and made him pay for
them.</p>

<p>After he was D. of Divinity, he sang ballads at the
Crosse at Abingdon on a market-day. He and some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>his camerades were at the taverne by the crosse,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[L.]</a> (which
by the way was then the finest of England;
I remember it when I was a freshman: it
was admirable curious Gothique architecture,
and fine figures in the niches: 'twas one of those
built by king ... for his queen: vide Chronicle).
The ballad singer complaynd, he had no custome, he could
not putt-off his ballades. The jolly Doctor putts-off his
gowne, and putts-on the ballad singer's leathern jacket,
and being a handsome man, and had a rare full voice,
he presently vended a great many, and had a great
audience.</p>

<p>He had a good interest with great men, as you may find
in his poems, and with the then great favourite, the duke of
Bucks; his excellent witt was lettres of recommendation to
him. I have forgott the story, but at the same time that
Dr. &lt;Samuel&gt; Fell thought to have carried it, Dr. Corbet
putt a pretty trick on &lt;him&gt; to lett him take a journey
on purpose to London for it, when he had already the
graunt of it.</p>

<p>He preacht a sermon before the king at Woodstock
(I suppose king James, quaere) and no doubt with a very
good grace; but it happened that he was out, on which
occasion there were made these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>His conversation<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> was extreme pleasant. Dr. Stubbins<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[CR]</a>
was one of his cronies; he was a jolly fatt Dr. and a very
good house-keeper; parson of &lt;Ambrosden&gt; in Oxfordshire.
As Dr. Corbet and he were riding in Lob-lane, in wett
weather, ('tis an extraordinary deepe dirty lane) the
coach fell; and Dr. Corbet sayd that Dr. Stubbins was
up to the elbowes in mud, he was up to the elbowes in
Stubbins.</p>

<p>Anno Domini &lt;1628&gt; he was made bishop of Oxford, and
I have heard that he had an admirable, grave, and venerable
aspect.</p>

<p>One time, as he was confirming, the country people
pressing in to see<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> the ceremonie, sayd he, '<i>Beare-off there,
or I'le confirme yee with my staffe</i>.' Another time being to
lay his hand on the head of a man very bald, he turns to
his chaplaine (Lushington) and sayd, '<i>Some dust, Lushington</i>,'
(to keepe his hand from slipping). There was a man with
a great venerable beard; sayd the bishop, '<i>You, behind the
beard</i>.'</p>

<p>His chaplain, Dr. Lushington<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[CS]</a>, was a very learned and
ingeniose man, and they loved one another. The bishop
sometimes would take the key of the wine-cellar, and he and
his chaplaine would goe and lock themselves in and be merry.
Then first he layes downe his episcopall hat,&mdash;'<i>There lyes
the Dr.</i>' Then he putts of his gowne,&mdash;'<i>There lyes the
Bishop</i>.' Then 'twas,&mdash;'<i>Here's to thee, Corbet</i>,' and '<i>Here's
to thee, Lushington</i>.'&mdash;From Josias Howe, B.D., Trin.
Coll. Oxon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>He built a pretty house (quaere) neer the cawsey beyond
Friar Bacon's studie.</p>

<p>He married<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[CT]</a> ..., whom 'twas sayd he begott. She
was a very beautifull woman, and so was her mother. He
had a son (I think Vincent) that went to schoole at Westminster,
with Ned Bagshawe; a very handsome youth, but
he is run out of all, and goes begging up and downe to
gentlemen.</p>

<p>He was made bishop of Norwich, Anno Domini &lt;1632&gt;.
He dyed &lt;28 July, 1635&gt;. The last words he sayd were,
'<i>Good night, Lushington</i>.' He lyes buried in the upper end
of the choire at Norwich, [on the south side of the monument
of bishop Herbert, the founder, under a faire gravestone
of free-stone, from whence the inscription<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[CU]</a> and

that one time when they went in procession about the

was elder brother to the right reverend father in God,
the learned John Davenant, bishop of Sarum.</p>

<p>I will first speake of the father, for he was a rare<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> man
in his time, and deserves to be remembred. He was of
a healthy complexion<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>, rose at 4 or 5 in the morning, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>that he followed his studies till 6 or 7, the time that other
merchants goe about their businesse; so that, stealing so
much and so quiet time in the morning, he studied as
much as most men. He understood Greeke and Latin
perfectly, and was a better Grecian then the bishop. He
writt a rare Greeke character as ever I sawe. He was
a great mathematician, and understood as much of it as
was knowen in his time. Dr. Davenant, his son, hath
excellent notes of his father's, in mathematiques, as also
in Greeke, and 'twas no small advantage &lt;to&gt; him to have
such a learned father to imbue arithmeticall knowledge
into him when a boy, night times when he came from
schoole (Merchant Taylors'). He understood trade very
well, was a sober and good menager, but the winds and
seas cross'd him. He had so great losses that he broke,
but his creditors knowing it was no fault of his, and also
that he was a person of great vertue and justice, used not
extremity towards him; but I thinke gave him more
credit, so that he went into Ireland, and did sett up
a fishery for pilchards at Wythy Island, in Ireland, where
in ... yeares he gott 10000 <i>li.</i>; satisfied and payd his
creditors; and over and above left a good estate to his
son. His picture bespeakes him to be a man of judgement,
and parts, and gravity extraordinary. There is written
<i>Expecto</i>. He slipt comeing downe the stone stayres at
the palace at Sarum, which bruise caused his death. He
lyes buried in the south aissle of the choire in Sarum
Cathedral behind the bishop's stall. His son, Dr. Davenant,
sett up and made this inscription for him, which I will
remember as well as I can:&mdash;</p>

thence to Queen's Colledge in Cambridge, of which house
his uncle, John Davenant, (afterwards bishop of Sarum),
was head, where<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> he was fellowe.</p>

<p>When his uncle was preferred to the church of Sarum,
he made his nephew treasurer of the church, which is the
best dignity, and gave him the vicaridge of Gillingham
in com. Dorset, and then Paulsholt parsonage, neer the
Devises, which last in the late troubles he resigned to his
wive's brother &lt;William&gt; Grove.</p>

<p>He was to his dyeing day of great diligence in study,
well versed in all kinds of learning, but his genius did
most strongly encline him to the mathematiques, wherin
he has written (in a hand as legible as print) MSS. in 4to
a foot high at least. I have often heard him say (jestingly)
that he would have a man knockt in the head that should
write any thing in mathematiques that had been written
of before. I have heard Sir Christopher Wren say that he
does beleeve he was the best mathematician in the world
about 30 or 35 + yeares agoe. But being a divine he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>unwilling to print, because the world should not know how
he had spent the greatest part of his time.</p>

<p>He very rarely went any farther then the church, which
is hard by his house. His wife was a very discreet and
excellent huswife, that he troubled himselfe about no
mundane affaires, and 'tis a private place, that he was but
little diverted with visitts.</p>

<p>I have writt to his executor, that we may have the
honour and favour to conserve his MSS. in the Library
of the Royal Societie, and to print what is fitt. I hope
I shall obtaine my desire. And the bishop of Exon
(&lt;Thomas&gt; Lamplugh) maried the Dr's second daughter
Katherine, and he was tutor to Sir Joseph Williamson,
our President. He had a noble library, which was the
aggregate of his father's, the bishop's, and his owne.</p>

<p>He was of middling stature, something spare; and
weake, feeble leggs; he had sometimes the goute; was
of great temperance, he alwayes dranke his beer at meales
with a toast, winter and summer, and sayd it made the
beer the better.</p>

<p>He was not only a man of vast learning, but of great
goodnes and charity; the parish and all his friends will have
a great losse in him. He tooke no use for money upon
bond. He was my singular good friend, and to whom
I have been more beholding then to any one beside; for
I borrowed five hundred pounds of him for a yeare and
a halfe, and I could not fasten any interest on him.</p>

<p>He was very ready to teach and instruct. He did<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
me the favour to informe me first in Algebra. His
daughters were Algebrists.</p>

<p>His most familiar learned acquaintance was Lancelot
Morehouse, parson of Pertwood. I remember when I was
a young Oxford scholar, that he could not endure to heare
of the <i>New</i> (Cartesian, or &amp;c.) <i>Philosophy</i>; 'for,' sayd he,
'if a new philosophy is brought-in, a new divinity will
shortly follow' (or 'come next'); and he was right.</p>

<p>He dyed at his house at Gillingham aforesaid, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and his predecessor, Dr. &lt;John&gt; Jessop, had been vicars
one hundred and ... yeares, and lyes buryed in the
chancell there. Obiit March 9th, 1679/80, and was buried the
31 of the same month.</p>

<p>He was heire to his uncle, John Davenant, bishop of
Sarum. Memorandum:&mdash;when bishop Coldwell<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[DK]</a> came to
this bishoprick, he did lett long leases, which were but
newly expired when bishop Davenant came to this sea;
so that there tumbled into his coffers vast summes. His
predecessor, Dr. Tounson, maried his sister, continued in
the see but a little while, and left severall children unprovided
for, so the king or rather duke of Bucks gave
bishop Davenant the bishoprick out of pure charity<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[DL]</a>.
Sir Anthony Weldon sayes (in his <i>Court of King James</i>),
'twas the only bishoprick that he disposed of without
symony, all others being made merchandise of for the
advancement of his kindred. Bishop Davenant being
invested, maried all his nieces to clergie-men, so he was
at no expence for their preferment. He granted to his
nephew (this Dr.) the lease of the great mannour of
Poterne, worth about 1000 <i>li.</i> per annum; made him
threasurer of the church of Sarum, of which the corps is
the parsonage of Calne, which was esteemed to be of the
like value. He made severall purchases, all which he
left him; insomuch as the churchmen of Sarum say, that
he gained more by this church then ever any man did by
the church since the Reformation, and take it very
unkindly that, at his death, he left nothing (or but 50 <i>li.</i>)
to that church which was the source of his estate.
How it happened I know not, or how he might be
workt-on in his old age, but I have heard severall yeares
since, he had sett downe 500 <i>li.</i> in will for the Cathedral
Church of Sarum.</p>

<p>He had 6 sonnes and 4 daughters. There was a good
schoole at Gillingham: at winter nights he taught his
sonnes Arithmetic and Geometric; his 2 eldest daughters,
especially Mris Ettrick, was a notable Algebrist.</p>

<p>&#9758; <i>Memoria.</i> He had an excellent way of improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
his children's memories, which was thus: he would make
one of them read a chapter or &amp;c., and then they were
(<i>sur le champ</i>) to repeate what they remembred, which did
exceedingly profitt them; and so for sermons, he did not
let them write notes (which jaded their memorie), but
gave an account <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>. When his eldest son, John,
came to Winton-schoole (where the boyes were enjoyned
to write sermon notes) he had not wrote; the master askt
him for his notes&mdash;he had none, but sayd, 'If I doe not
give you as good an account of it as they that doe, I am
much mistaken.'</p>

<i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>&mdash;baptized 3 of March <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1605/6], in ...
street in the city of Oxford at the Crowne taverne.</p>

<p>His father was John Davenant, a vintner
there, a very grave and discreet citizen: his
mother was a very beautifull woman, and of a
very good witt, and of conversation extremely
agreable. They had three sons, viz. 1, Robert<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[LII.]</a>,
2, William<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>; and 3, Nicholas (an attorney): and
two handsome daughters, one married to Gabriel Bridges
(B.D., fellow of C. C. Coll., beneficed in the Vale of White
Horse), another to Dr. &lt;William&gt; Sherburne (minister of
Pembridge in Hereford, and a canon of that church).</p>

<p>Mr. William Shakespeare was wont to goe into Warwickshire
once a yeare, and did commonly in his journey lye
at this house in Oxon. where he was exceedingly respected.
[I<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> have heard parson Robert &lt;Davenant&gt; say that
Mr. W. Shakespeare haz given him a hundred kisses.] Now
Sir William would sometimes, when he was pleasant over
a glasse of wine with his most intimate friends&mdash;e.g. Sam.
Butler (author of Hudibras), &amp;c.&mdash;say, that it seemed to
him that he writt with the very spirit that Shakespeare,
and seemd<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> contented<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> enough to be thought his son.
[He<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> would tell them the story as above, in which way
his mother had a very light report<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>.]</p>

<p>He went to schoole at Oxon to Mr. Sylvester (Charles
Whear, filius Degorii W., was his schoolefellowe), but I feare
he was drawne from schoole before he was ripe enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>He was preferred to the first dutches of Richmond to
wayte on her as a page. I remember he told me, she
sent him to a famous apothecary for some Unicornes-horne,
which he was resolved to try with a spider which he
incircled<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> in it, but without the expected successe; the
spider would goe over, and thorough and thorough, unconcerned.</p>

<p>He was next a servant (as I remember, a page also)
to Sir Fulke Grevil<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> lord Brookes, with whom he lived to
his death, which was that a servant of his (that had long
wayted on him and his lordship had often told him that
he would doe something for him, but did not but still putt
him off with delayes) as he was trussing up his lord's
pointes comeinge from stoole (for then their breeches were
fastned to the doubletts with points&mdash;then came in hookes
and eies&mdash;which not to have fastened was in my boy-hood
a great crime) stabbed him. This was at the same time
that the duke of Buckingham was stabbed by Felton, and
the great noise and report of the duke's, Sir William told
me, quite drowned this of his lord's, that 'twas scarce taken
notice of. This Sir Fulke G. was a good witt, and had
been a good poet<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> in his youth. He wrote a poeme in
folio which he printed not till he was old, and then, (as
Sir W. said) with too much judgment and refining, spoyld
it, which was at first a delicate thing.</p>

<p>He writt a play or playes, and verses, which he did with
so much sweetnesse and grace, that by it he got the love
and friendship of his two Mecaenasses, Mr. Endymion
Porter, and Mr. Henry Jermyn (since earl of St. Albans),
to whom he has dedicated his poem called <i>Madegascar</i>.
Sir John Suckling also was his great and intimate friend.</p>

<p>After the death of Ben Johnson he was made in his
place Poet Laureat.</p>

<p>He gott a terrible clap of a black handsome wench that
lay in Axe-yard, Westminster, whom he thought on when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>he speakes of <i>Dalga</i> in <i>Gondibert</i>, which cost him his nose,
with which unlucky mischance many witts were to&lt;o&gt;
cruelly bold: e.g. Sir John Menis, Sir John Denham, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>In 1641, when the troubles began, he was faine to
fly into France, and at Canterbury he was seised on by
the mayor&mdash;vide Sir John Menis' verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For Will had in his face the flawes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And markes recieved in countrey's cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flew on him like lyons passant,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">. . . . . 'Twas surely the first time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Will's religion was a crime.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the civill warres in England he was in the army of
William, marquess of Newcastle (since duke), where he was
generall of the ordinance. I have heard his brother Robert
say, for that service there was owing to him by King
Charles the First 10000 <i>li.</i> During that warre, 'twas his hap
to have two aldermen of Yorke his prisoners, who were
something stubborne, and would not give the ransome
ordered by the councell of warr. Sir William used them
civilly, and treated them in his tent, and sate them at the
upper end of his table &agrave; la mode de France, and having
donne so a good while to his chardge, told them (privately
and friendly) that he was not able to keepe so chargeable
guests, and bad them take an opportunity to escape, which
they did; but having been gon a little way they considered
with themselves that in gratitude they ought to goe back
and give Sir William their thankes; which they did, but it
was like to have been to their great danger of being taken
by the soldiers; but they happened to gett safe to Yorke.</p>

<p>The King's party being overcome, Sir William Davenant
(who received the honour of knighthood from the duke
of Newcastle by commision) went into France; resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
chiefly in Paris where the Prince of Wales then was. He
then began to write his romance in verse, called <i>Gondibert</i>,
and had not writt above the first booke, but being very
fond of it, prints it (before a quarter finished), with an
epistle of his to Mr. Thomas Hobbes and Mr. Hobbes'
excellent epistle to him printed before it. The courtiers
with the Prince of Wales could never be at quiet about
this piece, which was the occasion of a very witty but
satericall little booke of verses in 8vo. about 4 sheetes, writt
by George, duke of Buckes, Sir John Denham, etc.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That thou forsak'st thy sleepe, thy diet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which is more then that, <i>our quiet</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This last word Mr. Hobs told me was the occasion of
their writing.</p>

<p>Here he layd an ingeniose designe to carry a considerable
number of artificers (chiefly weavers) from hence to
Virginia; and by Mary the queen-mother's meanes, he
got favour from the king of France to goe into the prisons
and pick and choose. So when the poor dammed wretches
understood what the designe was, the&lt;y&gt; cryed <i>uno ore</i>&mdash;'<i>Tout
tisseran!</i>' i.e. <i>We are all weavers!</i> Will. &lt;took&gt; 36,
as I remember, if not<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>more, and shipped them; and<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>
as he was in his voyage towards Virginia, he and his
<i>tisseran</i> were all taken by the shippes then belonging
to the Parliament of England. The slaves I suppose
they sold, but Sir William was brought prisoner to
England. Whither he was first a prisoner at Caresbroke-castle
in the Isle of Wight, or at the Tower of
London, I have forgott: he was a prisoner at both. His
<i>Gondibert</i>, 4to, was finished at Caresbroke-castle. He
expected no mercy from the Parliament, and had no hopes
of escaping &lt;with&gt; his life. It pleased God that the two
aldermen of Yorke aforesayd hearing that he was taken
and brought to London to be tryed for his life, which
they understood was in extreme danger, they were
touch&lt;ed&gt; with so much generosity and goodnes, as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>upon their owne accounts and meer motion, to try what
they could to save Sir William's life who had
been so civill to them and a meanes to save

<p>Being freed from imprisonment, (because
playes, scil. Tragedies and Comoedies, were
in those Presbyterian times scandalous) he
contrives to set-up an Opera <i>stylo recitativo</i>,
wherein serjeant Maynard and severall citizens
were engagers. It began at Rutland-house, in
Charter-house-yard; next, (scil. anno ...) at
the Cock-pitt in Drury-lane, where were acted
very well <i>stylo recitativo</i>, <i>Sir Francis Drake's ...</i>,
and <i>the Siege of Rhodes</i> (1st and 2d part). It did affect
the eie and eare extremely. This first brought scenes in
fashion in England; before, at playes, was only a hanging.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1660 was the happy restauration of his
majestie Charles II. Then was Sir Wm. made ...;
and the Tennis court in Little Lincolnes-Inne

<p>He was a great peace-maker; if any of the neighbours
fell out, he would never lett them alone till he had made
them friends.</p>

<p>He was tall and slender. He wore a gowne like an

so; but he would not gett the lost horses, though he was

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Quaere Dr. Buzby if he was a Westminster schollar&mdash;I
have forgot. Anno ... he was admitted of Trinity
Colledge in Oxford, where he stayed.... His tutor there
was.... I have heard Mr. Josias Howe say that he
was the dreamingst young fellow; he never expected such
things from him as he haz left the world. When he was
there he would game extremely; when he had played
away all his money he would play away his father's wrought
rich gold cappes.</p>

<p>His father was Sir John Denham, one of the Barons of
the Exchequer. He had been one of the Lords Justices in
Ireland: he maried Ellenor<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[LX.]</a>, one of the daughters of Sir
Garret Moore, knight, lord baron of Mellifont,
in the kingdome of Ireland, whom he maried
during his service in Ireland in the place of
Chief Justice there.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_182" id="Footnote_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_182"><span class="label">[LX.]</span></a> She was a
beautifull
woman, as
appeares by her
monument at
Egham. Sir
John, they say,
did much
resemble his
father.</p></div>

<p>From Trinity Colledge he went to Lincolnes-Inne,
where (as judge Wadham Windham<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>,
who was his contemporary, told me) he was as good
a student as any in the house. Was not suspected to be
a witt.</p>

<p>At last, viz. 1640, his play of <i>The Sophy</i> came out, which
did take extremely: Mr. Edmund Waller sayd
then of him, that he <i>broke-out like the Irish
Rebellion<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[LXI.]</a>&mdash;threescore thousand strong</i>, before any body
was aware<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_183" id="Footnote_183"></a><a href="#FNanchor_183"><span class="label">[LXI.]</span></a> His play came
out at that time.</p></div>

<p>He was much rooked by gamesters, and fell
acquainted with that unsanctified crew, to his
ruine. His father had some suspition of it, and
chid him severely, wherupon his son John (only
child) wrot a little essay in 8vo, printed ...,
<i>Against<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[LXII.]</a> gameing and to shew the vanities and
inconveniences of it</i>, which he presented to his
father to let him know his detestation of it<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[DT]</a>.
But shortly after his father's death<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[LXIII.]</a> (who left 2,000 or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>1,500 <i>li.</i> in ready money, 2 houses well furnished, and
much plate) the money was played away first, and next
the plate was sold. I remember about 1646 he lost
200 <i>li.</i> one night at New-cutt. Anno ... (I ghesse 1642)
he was high-sheriff of the countie of Surrey.</p>

at Egham
in Surrey.</p></div>

<p>At the beginning of the civill warre he was made
governor of Farnham-castle for the king, but he was but
a young soldier, and did not keepe it. In 1642/3, after Edghill
fight, his poeme called <i>Cowper's Hill</i> was printed at Oxford,
in a sort of browne paper, for then they could gett no better.</p>

<p>1646/7 (quaere) he conveyed, or stole away, the two dukes
of Yorke and Glocester from St. James's (from the tuition
of the earle of Northumberland), and conveyed them into
France to the Prince of Wales and Queen-mother. King
Charles II sent him and the lord Culpepper envoyes to the
king of Poland,....</p>

<p>Anno 1652, he returned into England, and being in
some straights was kindly entertayned by the earle of
Pembroke at Wilton, where I had the honour to contract
an acquaintance with him. Here he translated the ...
booke of Vergil's <i>&AElig;neis</i>, and also burlesqu't it<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[LXIV.]</a>:
quaere Mr. Christopher Wase who was then
there, tutor to William<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>, lord Herbert. He
was, as I remember, a yeare with my lord of
Pembroke at Wilton and London; he had
then sold all the lands his father had left him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_186" id="Footnote_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_186"><span class="label">[LXIV.]</span></a> He burlesqued
Virgil, and
burnt it, sayeing
that 'twas not
fitt that the best
poet should be
so abused.&mdash;From
Mr.
Christopher
Wase.</p></div>

<p>His first wife was the daughter and heire of ... Cotton,
of ... in Glocestershire, by whom he had 500 <i>li.</i> per
annum, one son and two daughters.<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>His son did not
<i>patrem sapere</i>. He was of Wadham College<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> in Dr.
Wilkins's time: he dyed <i>sine prole</i>, I thinke, there.&mdash;One of
his daughters is maried to ... Morley, of Sussex, esq.;
the other....</p>

<p>He was much beloved by King Charles the First, who
much valued him for his ingenuity. He graunted him the
reversion of the surveyor of his majestie's buildings, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>the decease of Mr. Inigo Jones; which place, after the
restauration of King Charles II he enjoyed to his death, and
gott seaven thousand pounds, as Sir Christopher Wren told
me of, to his owne knowledge. Sir Christopher Wren was
his deputie.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 166.. he maried his 2d wife, &lt;Margaret&gt;
Brookes, a very beautifull young lady; Sir John was ancient
and limping. The duke of Yorke fell deepely in love with
her, though (I have been morally assured) he never had
carnall knowledge of her. This occasioned Sir John's
distemper of madnesse in 166.., which first appeared when
he went from London to see the famous free-stone quarries
at Portland in Dorset, and when he came within a mile of
it, turned back to London again, and did<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> not see it. He
went to Hownslowe, and demanded rents of lands he had
sold many yeares before; went to the king, and told him
he was the Holy Ghost. But it pleased God that he
was cured of this distemper, and writt excellent verses
(particularly on the death of Mr. Abraham Cowley) afterwards.
His 2d lady had no child; was poysoned by the
hands of Co. of Roc.<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> with chocolatte.</p>

<p>At the coronation of King Charles II he was made
Knight of the Bath.</p>

<p>He dyed (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>) at the house
of his office (which he built, as also the brick-buildings next
the street in Scotland-yard), and was buried, anno Domini
1668/9, March the 23, in the south crosse aisle of Westminster
Abbey, neer Sir Jeffrey Chaucer's monument, but hitherto
(1680) without any memoriall for him.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;the parsonage-house at Egham (vulgarly
called <i>The Place</i>) was built by baron Denham; a house
very convenient, not great, but pretty, and pleasantly
scituated, and in which his son, Sir John, (though he
had better seates), did take most delight in. He sold it
to John Thynne, esq. In this parish is a place called
Cammomill-hill, from the cammomill that growes there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>naturally; as also west of it is Prune-well-hill (formerly
part of Sir John's possessions), where was a fine tuft of
trees, a clear spring, and a pleasant prospect to the east,
over the levell of Middlesex and Surrey. Sir John tooke
great delight in this place, and was wont to say (before the
troubles) that he would build there a retiring-place to
entertaine his muses; but the warres forced him to sell that
as well as the rest. He sold it to Mr. ... Anstey. In
this parish W. and by N. (above <i>Runney Meade</i>) is <i>Cowper's
Hill</i>, from whence is a noble prospect, which is incomparably
well described by that sweet swan, Sir John Denham;
printed first at Oxon shortly after Edghill fight, 1642/3.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;he delighted much in bowles, and did
bowle very well.</p>

<p>He was of the tallest, but a little incurvetting at his
shoulders, not very robust. His haire was but thin and
flaxen, with a moist curle. His gate was slow, and was
rather a stalking (he had long legges), which was wont to
putt me in mind of Horace, <i>De Arte Poetica</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hic, dum sublimes versus ructatur, et errat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si veluti merulis intentus decidit auceps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In puteum foveamve:'&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His eie was a kind of light goose-gray, not big; but it
had a strange piercingness, not as to shining and glory, but
(like a Momus) when he conversed with you he look't into
your very thoughts.</p>

<p>He was generally temperate as to drinking; but one
time when he was a student of Lincolne's-Inne, having
been merry at the taverne with his camerades, late at night,
a frolick came into his head, to gett a playsterer's brush
and a pott of inke, and blott out all the signes between
Temple-barre and Charing-crosse, which made a strange
confusion the next day, and 'twas in Terme time. But it
happened that they were discovered, and it cost him and
them some moneys. This I had from R. Estcott<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>, esq.,
that carried the inke-pott.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>In the time of the civill warres, George Withers, the
poet, begged Sir John Denham's estate at Egham of the
Parliament, in whose cause he was a captaine of horse. It
&lt;happened&gt; that G. W. was taken prisoner, and was in
danger of his life, having written severely against the king,
&amp;c. Sir John Denham went to the king, and desired
his majestie not to hang him, for that whilest G. W. lived
he should not be the worst poet in England.</p>

<p>Scripsit <i>the Sophy</i>: <i>Cowper's Hill</i>: <i>Essay against Gameing</i>:
Poems, 8vo, printed anno Domini ...; Cato Major
sive De Senectute, translated into English verse, London,
printed by H. Heringman, in the New Exchange, 1669.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;in the verses against Gondibert, most
of them are Sir John's. He was satyricall when he had
a mind to it.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>Monsieur Renatus Des Cartes,</p>

<p>How he spent his time in his youth, and by what method
he became so knowing, he tells the world in his treatise
entituled Of Method. The Societie of Jesus glorie in that
theyr order had the educating of him. He lived severall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
yeares at Egmont (neer the Hague), from whence he dated
severall of his bookes. He was too wise a man to encomber
himselfe with a wife; but as he was a man, he had the
desires and appetites of a man; he therefore kept a good
conditioned hansome woman that he liked, and by whom
he had some children (I thinke 2 or 3). 'Tis pity but
comeing from the braine<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> of such a father, they should be
well cultivated. He was so eminently learned that all
learned men made visits to him, and many of them would
desire him to shew them his ... of instruments (in those
dayes mathematicall learning lay much in the knowledge of
instruments, and, as Sir H. S.<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> sayd, in doeing of tricks),
he would drawe out a little drawer under his table, and
shew them a paire of compasses with one of the legges
broken; and then, for his ruler, he used a sheet of paper
folded double. This from Alexander Cowper (brother of
Samuel), limner to Christina, queen of Sweden, who was
familiarly acquainted there with Des Cartes.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>Mr. Hobbes was wont to say that had Des Cartes kept
himselfe wholy to geometrie that he had been the best
geometer in the world. He did very much admire him,

<p>It happened in 1647 that a grave was opened next to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Sir John Digby's (who was buried in summer time, it
seemes), and the flowers on his coffin were found fresh, as
I heard Mr. Harcourt (that was executed) attest that very
yeare. Sir John died a batchelour.</p>

<p>Sir Kenelme Digby was held to be the most accomplished
cavalier of his time. He went to Glocester hall in Oxon,
anno &lt;1618&gt; (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>). The learned
Mr. Thomas Allen (then of that house) was wont to say
that he was the <i>Mirandula</i> of his age. He did not weare
a gowne there<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>, as I have heard my cosen Whitney say.</p>

<p>There was a great friendship between him and Mr. Thomas
Allen; whether he was his scholar I know not. Mr. Allen
was one of the learnedest men of this nation in his time,
and a great collector of good bookes, which collection Sir
Kenelme bought (Mr. Allen enjoyeing the use of them for
his life) to give to the Bodlean Library, after Mr. Allen's
decease, where they<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> now are.</p>

<p>He was a great traveller, and understood 10 or 12
languages. He was not only master of a good and gracefull
judicious stile, but he also wrote a delicate hand,
both fast-hand and Roman. I have seen lettres of his
writing to the father<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> of this earle of Pembroke, who much
respected<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> him.</p>

<p>He was such a goodly handsome person, gigantique and
great voice, and had so gracefull elocution and noble
addresse, etc., that had he been drop't out of the clowdes<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>
in any part of the world, he would have made himselfe
respected. But the Jesuites spake spitefully, and sayd
'twas true, but then he must not stay there above six
weekes. He was envoy&eacute; from Henrietta Maria (then
Queen-mother) to Pope &lt;Innocent X&gt; where at first he was
mightily admired; but after some time he grew high, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>hectored with his holinesse, and gave him the lye. The
pope sayd he was mad.</p>

<p>He was well versed in all kinds of learning. And he
had also this vertue<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>, that no man <i>knew better how to abound,
and to be abased</i>, and either was indifferent to him. No
man became grandeur better<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>; sometimes again he would
live only with a lackey, and horse with a foote-cloath.</p>

<p>He was very generous, and liberall to deserving persons.
When Abraham Cowley was but 13 yeares old, he dedicated
to him a comedy<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>, called <i>Love's Riddle</i>, and concludes in
his epistle<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>&mdash;'The Birch that whip't him then would prove
a Bay.' Sir K. was very kind to him.</p>

<p>When he was at Rome one time, (I thinke he was envoy&eacute;
from Mary the Queen-mother to Pope &lt;Innocent X&gt;) he
contrasted<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> with his holinesse.</p>

<p>Anno ... (quaere the countesse of Thanet) much against
his mother's, etc., consent, he maried that celebrated beautie
and courtezane, Mrs. Venetia Stanley, whom Richard earle of
Dorset kept as his concubine, had children by her, and setled
on her an annuity of 500 <i>li.</i> per annum; which after Sir K. D.
maried was unpayd by the earle; and for which annuity
Sir Kenelme sued the earle, after mariage, and recovered it.
He would say that a handsome lusty man that was discreet
might make a vertuose wife out of a brothell-house. This
lady carried herselfe blamelessly, yet (they say) he was
jealous of her<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[LXVI.]</a>. She dyed suddenly, and
hard-hearted woemen<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> would censure him
severely.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_190" id="Footnote_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_190"><span class="label">[LXVI.]</span></a> Richard earle
of Dorset invited
her and her
husband once a
yeare, when,
with much desire
and passion he
beheld her, and
only kissed her
hand; Sir
Kenelme being
still by.</p></div>

<p>After her death, to avoyd envy and scandall,
he retired in to Gresham Colledge at London,
where he diverted himselfe with his chymistry,
and the professors' good conversation. He
wore there a long mourning cloake, a high crowned hatt,
his beard unshorne, look't like a hermite, as signes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>sorrowe for his beloved wife, to whose memory he erected
a sumptuouse monument, now quite destroyed by the
great conflagration. He stayed at the colledge<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> two or
3 yeares.</p>

<p>The faire howses in Holbourne, between King's street
and Southampton street, (which brake-off the continuance
of them) were, about 1633, built by Sir Kenelme; where he
lived before the civill warres. Since the restauration of
Charles II he lived in the last faire house westward in the
north portico of Convent garden, where my lord Denzill
Hollis lived since. He had a laboratory there. I thinke he
dyed in this house&mdash;sed quaere.</p>

<p>He was, 164.., prisoner for the king (Charles I) at
Winchester-house, where he practised chymistry<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>, and
wrote his booke of<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> Bodies and Soule, which he dedicated
to his eldest son, Kenelme, who was slaine (as I take it) in
the earle of Holland's riseing<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>.</p>

<p>Anno 163 ... tempore Caroli I<sup>mi</sup> he received the sacrament
in the chapell at Whitehall, and professed the Protestant
religion, which gave great scandal to the Roman Catholiques;
but afterwards he <i>looked back</i>.</p>

<p>He was a person of very extraordinary strength. I remember
one at<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>Shirburne (relating to the earl of Bristoll)
protested to us, that as he, being a midling man, being sett
in &lt;a&gt; chaire, Sir Kenelme tooke up him, chaire and all, with
one arme.</p>

<p>He was of an undaunted courage, yet not apt in the
least to give offence. His conversation was both ingeniose
and innocent.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas White, who wrote <i>de Mundo</i>, 1641<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>, and
Mr. ... Hall of Leige, e societate Jesu, were two of his
great friends.</p>

<p>As for that great action of his at Scanderoon, see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>Turkish Historie. Sir &lt;Edward&gt; Stradling, of Glamorganshire,
was then his vice-admirall, at whose house is an
excellent picture of his, as he was at that time: by him
is drawen an armillary sphaere broken, and undernethe is
writt IMPAVIDUM FERIENT (Horace). See excellent
verses of Ben: Johnson (to whome he was a great patrone)
in his 2d volumne.</p>

<p>There is in print in French, and also in English (translated
by Mr. James Howell), a speech that he made at
a philosophicall assembly at Montpelier, 165.. <i>Of the
sympathetique powder</i>&mdash;see it<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>. He made a speech at the
beginning of the meeting of the Royall Society <i>Of the
vegetation of plants</i>.</p>

<p>He was borne to three thousand pounds per annum.
His ancient seat (I thinke) is Gote-herst in Buckinghamshire.
He had a fair estate also in Rutlandshire. What
by reason of the civil warres, and his generous mind, he
contracted great debts, and I know not how (there being
a great falling out between him and his <i>then</i> only son,
John<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[LXVII.]</a>) he settled his estate upon ... Cornwalleys,
a subtile sollicitor<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>, and also a member

<p>Mr. J. D. had a good estate of his owne,
and lived handsomely then at what time I
went to him two or 3 times in order to your <i>Oxon.
Antiqu.</i>; and he then brought me a great book, as
big as the biggest Church Bible that ever I sawe, and
the richliest bound, bossed with silver, engraven with
scutchions and crest (an ostrich); it was a curious
velame<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>. It was the history of the family of the Digbyes,
which Sir Kenelme either did, or ordered to be donne.
There was inserted all that was to be found any where
relating to them, out of records of the Tower, rolles,
&amp;c. All ancient church monuments were most exquisitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>limmed by some rare artist. He told me that the compileing
of it did cost his father a thousand pound. Sir
Jo. Fortescue sayd he did beleeve 'twas more. When Mr.
John Digby did me the favour to shew me this rare MS.,
'This booke,' sayd he, 'is all that I have left me of all the
estate that was my father's!' He was almost as tall and
as big as his father: he had something<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> of the sweetnesse
of his mother's face. He was bred by the Jesuites, and
was a good scholar. He dyed at....</p>

servants at Enston-abbey<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[LXVIII.]</a> (his land, or the earl
of Derby's) in Oxfordshire; but as private as
that place was, it seemes her beautie could
not lye hid. The young eagles had espied
her, and she was sanguine and tractable, and
of much suavity (which to abuse was greate
pittie).</p>

<p>The earle of Dorset, aforesayd, was her greatest gallant,
who was extremely enamoured of her, and had<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> one if not
more children by her. He setled on her an annuity of
500 <i>li.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>Among other young sparkes of that time, Sir Kenelme
Digby grew acquainted with her, and fell so much in love
with her that he married her, much against the good will
of his mother; but he would say that 'a wise man, and
lusty, could make an honest woman out of a brothell-house.'
Sir Edmund Wyld had her picture<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[LXX.]</a> (and you

altar of black marble with 4 inscriptions in copper gilt
affixed to it: upon this altar her bust of copper gilt, all
which (unlesse the vault, which was onely opened a little
by the fall) is utterly destroyed by the great conflagration.
Among the monuments in the booke mentioned in Sir
Kenelm Digby's life, is to be seen a curious draught of
this monument, with copies of the severall inscriptions.</p>

<p>About 1676 or 5, as I was walking through Newgate-street,
I sawe Dame Venetia's bust standing at a stall at
the Golden Crosse, a brasier's shop. I perfectly remembred
it, but the fire had gott-off the guilding: but taking notice
of it to one that was with me, I could never see it afterwards
exposed to the street. They melted it downe. How these
curiosities would be quite forgott, did not such idle fellowes
as I am putt them downe!</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;at Goathurst, in Bucks<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>, is a rare
originall picture of Sir Kenelme Digby and his lady Venetia,
in one piece, by the hand of Sir Anthony van Dyke. In

<p>'L. D. to the Reader&mdash;Although many have put forth
sufficient and certain rules to measure all manner of
superficies, etc., yet in that the art of numbring hath been
required, yea, chiefly those rules hid and as it were locked
up in strange tongues, they doe profit or have furthered
very little, for the most part, yea, nothing at all, the
landmeater, carpenter, mason, wanting the aforesayd. For
their sakes I am here provoked not to hide but to open
the talent I have recieved, yea, to publish in this our
tongue very shortly if God give life a volumne containing
the flowers of the sciences mathematicall largely applied
to our outward practise profitably pleasant to all manner
men. Here mine advice shall be to those artificers, that
will profit in this or any of my bookes &#9758; now published,
or that hereafter shall be, first confusedly to read them

<p>His father tooke great care to send him to an excellent
schoole, which was at Dusseldorf, in Cleveland. He was
a tender chitt, and his mother would not entruste him
at board<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>, but tooke a house there, and made him

<p>He loved not fish, though borne in a fish towne&mdash;from
Sir George Ent, M.D.</p>

<p>&lt;From&gt; Dr. John Pell:&mdash;he was of the order of ...,
whose habit was the same that the pest-house master
at ... (I thinke, Pisa: quaere Dr. John Pell) in Italie
wore; and walking in that towne, people beckoned him
to goe out of the way, taking him to be the master of
the pest-house; and he not understanding the meaning,
and keeping on his way, was there by one well basted.
He made his complaint when he came to Rome, and had
a dispensation for his habit.</p>

<p>He studied sometime in Queens Colledge in Cambridge:
his chamber was over the water. Quaere Mr. Paschal
more particularly; and if a fellowe: he<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> had his study
when a young scholar here.</p>

<p>'The staires which rise up to his studie at Queens
Colledge in Cambridge doe bring first into two of the
fairest chambers in the ancient building; in one of them,
which lookes into the hall and chiefe court, the Vice-President
kept in my time; in that adjoyning, it was my
fortune to be, when fellow. The chambers over are good
lodgeing roomes; and to one of them is a square turret
adjoyning, in the upper part of which is that study of
Erasmus; and over it leades. To that belongs the best
prospect about the colledge, viz. upon the river, into the
corne-fields, and countrey adjoyning, etc.; &#9758; so that it
might very well consist with the civility of the House to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>that great man (who was no fellow, and I think stayed
not long there) to let him have that study. His keeping
roome might be either the Vice-President's, or, to be neer
to him, the next; the room for his servitor that above,
over it, and through it he might goe to that studie, which
for the height, and neatnesse, and prospect, might easily
take his phancy.' This from Mr. Andrew Paschal, Rector
of Chedzoy in Somerset, June 15, 1680.</p>

<p>He mentions his being there in one of his Epistles, and
blames the beere there. One, long since, wrote, in the
margent of the booke in &lt;the&gt; College library in which
that is sayd, '<i>Sicut erat in principio</i>, etc.'; and all Mr. Paschall's
time they found fault with the brewer.</p>

<p>He had the parsonage (quaere value) of Aldington in
Kent, which is about 3 degrees perhaps a healthier place
then Dr. Pell's parsonage in Essex. I wonder they could
not find for him<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> better preferment; but I see that the
Sun and Aries being in the second house<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>, he was not
borne to be a rich man.</p>

ordered the institution<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>. Sir George Ent was educated
there. A statue in brasse is erected to his memory on

<p>Sir Charles Blount, of Maple-Durham, in com. Oxon.
(neer Reding), was his scholar (in his Epistles there are
some to him), and desired Erasmus to doe him the favour<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
to sitt for his picture, and he did so, and it is an excellent

to gett it for Oxford Library.</p>

<p>They were wont to say that Erasmus was interpendent
between Heaven and Hell, till, about the year 1655 (quaere

<div class="footnotes"><h4><i>Note.</i></h4>

<p>Anthony Wood in the <i>Ath. Oxon.</i> gives a more correct version of this
story. William Gadbury, a farmer, of Wheatley, co. Oxon, made a stolen
marriage with a daughter of Sir John Curson of Waterperry. Their son, John
Gadbury, was apprentice to an Oxford tailor, before he set up as an astrologer.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Aubrey and Wood in MS. Wood F. 51, shows
that the publication of this story in Wood's <i>Athenae</i> was, very naturally,
resented by Gadbury. Aubrey to Wood, Aug. 20, 1692, Gadbury is 'extremely
incens't against you: ... he sayes that you have printed lyes concerning him.'
Aubrey to Wood, Oct. 21, 1693, 'I shewed your letter to Mr. Gadbury, wherin
you tell him that what he desires should be amended as to himselfe shall be
donne in the Appendix,' i.e. the third volume of the <i>Athenae</i>, on which Wood
was then at work, 'to be printed: but he huft and pish't, saying that your
copies are flown abroad and the scandalls are irrevocable and that he will have
a fling at you in print to vindicate himselfe.' Wood was blind to the indiscretion
he had committed: Wood to Aubrey, Nov. 1692, MS. Ballard 14, fol. 153:&mdash;'I
wonder at nothing more then that Mr. Gadbury should take it amiss of
those things that I say of him: for whereas the generality of scholars did
formerly take him to have been bred an academian, because he was borne at
Oxon, and so, consequently, not to be much admird, now their eyes being
opend and knowing that his education hath been mechanical they esteem him
a prodigie of parts and therfore are much desirous that his picture may hang in
the public gallery at the schooles.'</p></div>

funeral sermon in London. They told me that he was
good for little a great while, till at last it happened
accidentally, that he heard a Geometrie<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> lecture. He
was so taken with it, that immediately he fell to studying
it, and quickly made great progresse in it. The fine diall

<p>This Adrian Gilbert was an excellent chymist, and
a great favourite of Mary, countesse of Pembroke, with
whom he lived and was her operator. He was a man of
great parts, but the greatest buffoon in England; cared
not what he said to man or woman of what quality soever.

<p>He wrote <i>Observations on the bills of mortality</i> very
ingeniosely (but I beleeve, and partly know, that he had
his hint from his intimate and familiar friend Sir William

studious person, and generally beloved, and rose early in
the morning to his study before shop-time. He understood
Latin and French. He was a pleasant facetious companion,
and very hospitable.</p>

<p>He was bred-up (as the fashion then was) in the Puritan
way; wrote short-hand dextrously; and after many yeares
constant hearing and writing sermon-notes, he fell to buying
and reading of the best Socinian bookes, and for severall
yeares continued of that opinion. At last, about ..., he
turned a Roman Catholique, of which religion he dyed
a great zealot.</p>

<p>He was free of the drapers' company, and by profession
was a haberdasher of small-wares. He had gone through

<p>He was by trade a haberdasher of small wares, but was

I thinke I have heard Mr. John Sloper say (vicar of
Chalke; his mother was Mr. Hales's sister, and he bred
him at Eaton).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>His father was a steward to the family of the Horners:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Went to school, at Bath (as I take it). Fellow of
Merton Colledge. Assisted Sir Henry Savill in his edition
of Chrysostome (<i>cum aliis</i>). Afterwards fellow of Eaton
College.</p>

<p>Went chaplain to Sir Dudley Carlton (ambassador to ...).
I thinke was at the Synod of Dort.</p>

<p>When the Court was at Windsor, the learned courtiers
much delighted &lt;in&gt; his company, and were wont to grace
him with their company.</p>

<p>I have heard his nephew, Mr. Sloper, say, that he much
loved to read ... Stephanus, who was a <i>familist</i>, I thinke
that first wrote of that sect of the Familie of Love: he was
mightily taken with it, and was wont to say that sometime or
other those fine notions would take in the world. He was
one of the first Socinians in England, I thinke the first.</p>

<p>He was a generall scolar, and I beleeve a good poet: for
Sir John Suckling brings him into the Session of the Poets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Little Hales all the time did nothing but smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see them, about nothing, keepe such a coile.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had a noble librarie of bookes, and those judicially
chosen, which cost him ... <i>li.</i> (quaere Mr. Sloper); and
which he sold to Cornelius Bee, bookeseller, in Little
Britaine, (as I take it, for 1000 <i>li.</i>) which was his maintenance
after he was ejected out of his fellowship at Eaton College.
He had then only reserved some few for his private use, to
wind-up his last dayes withall.</p>

<p>The ladie Salter (neer Eaton) was very kind to him after
the sequestration; he was very welcome to her ladyship,
and spent much of his time there. At Eaton he lodged
(after his sequestration) at the next house &lt;to&gt; the
Christopher (inne), where I sawe him, a prettie little man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sanguine, of a cheerfull countenance, very gentile, and
courteous; I was recieved by him with much humanity: he
was in a kind of violet-colourd cloath gowne, with buttons
and loopes (he wore not a black gowne), and was reading
Thomas &agrave; Kempis; it was within a yeare before he deceased.
He loved Canarie; but moderately, to refresh his spirits.</p>

<p>He had a bountifull mind. I remember in 1647, a little
after the Visitation<a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>, when Thomas Mariett, esq., Mr. William
Radford, and Mr. Edward Wood (all of Trinity College)
had a frolique from Oxon to London, on foot, having never
been there before, they happened to take Windsore in their
way, made their addresse to this good gentleman, being
then fellow. Mr. Edward Wood was the spookes-man,
remonstrated that they were Oxon scholars: he treated
them well, and putt into Mr. Wood's hands ten shillings.</p>

<p>He lies buried in the church yard at Eaton, under an
altar monument of black marble, erected at the sole chardge
of Mr. ... Curwyn, with a too long epitaph. He was no
kiff or kin to him.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>Mr. John Hales dyed at Mris Powney's house, a widow-woman,
in Eaton, opposite to the churchyard, adjoyning to
the Christopher Inne southwards. 'Tis the howse where
I sawe him.</p>

<p>She is a very good woman and of a gratefull spirit. She
told me that when she was maried, Mr. Hales was very
bountifull to them in helping them<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> to live in the world.
She was very gratefull to him and respectfull to him.</p>

<p>She told me that Mr. Hales was the common godfather
there, and 'twas pretty to see, as he walked to Windsor,
how his godchildren asked him blessing<a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>. When he was
bursar, he still gave away all his groates for the acquittances
to his godchildren; and by that time he came to Windsor
bridge, he would have never a groate left.</p>

<p>This Mris Powney assures me that the poor were more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>relieveable, that is to say, that he recieved more kindnesse
from them than from the rich. That that I putt downe
of my lady Salter (sister to Brian Duppa, bishop of
Sarum), from his nephew &lt;John&gt; Sloper, vicar of Chalke,
is false<a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>. She had him to her house indeed, but 'twas
to teach her sonne, who was such a blockhead he could
not read well.</p>

<p>Cornelius Bee bought his library for 700 <i>li.</i>, which cost
him not lesse then 2,500 <i>li.</i> Mris Powney told me that she
was much against the sale of 'em, because she knew it was
his life and joy.</p>

<p>He might have been restored to his fellowship again, but
he would not accept the offer. He was not at all covetous,
and desired only to leave x <i>li.</i> to bury him.</p>

<p>He bred-up our vicar, [Sloper<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>], who, she told me, never
sent him a token; and he is angry with her, thinks he left
her too much.</p>

<p>She is a woman primitively good, and deserves to be
remembred. I wish I had her Christian name. Her
husband has an inscription on a gravestone in Eaton College
chapel towards the south wall.</p>

<p>She has a handsome darke old-fashioned howse. The
hall, after the old fashion, above the wainscot, painted
cloath, with godly sentences out of the Psalmes, etc.,
according to the pious custome of old times; a convenient
garden and orchard. She has been handsome: a good
understanding, and cleanlie.</p>

son of &lt;Edmund&gt; Halley, a soape-boyler, a wealthy citizen
of the city of London; of the Halleys, of Derbyshire,
a good family.</p>

<p>He was born in Shoreditch parish, at a place called
Haggerston, the backside of Hogsdon.</p>

<p>At 9 yeares old, his father's apprentice taught him
to write, and arithmetique. He went to Paule's schoole to
Dr. Gale: while he was there he was very perfect in
the Caelestiall Globes insomuch that I heard Mr. Moxon
(the globe-maker) say that if a star were misplaced in the
globe, he would presently find it.</p>

<p>At ... he studyed Geometry, and at 16 could make
a dyall, and then, he said, thought himselfe a brave
fellow.</p>

<p>At &lt;16&gt; went to Queen's Colledge in Oxon, well versed
in Latin, Greeke, and Hebrew: where, at the age of
nineteen, he solved this useful probleme in astronomie,
never donne before, &#9758; viz. 'from 3 distances given from
the sun, and angles between, to find the orbe' (mentioned
in the Philosophicall Transactions, Aug. or Sept. 1676,
No. 115), for which his name will be ever famous.</p>

<p>Anno Domini ... tooke his degree of Bacc. Art.;
Anno Domini ... tooke his degree of Master of Arts<a name="FNanchor_1371" id="FNanchor_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>.</p>

<p>Anno ... left Oxon, and lived at London with his
father till &lt;1676&gt;; at which time he gott leave, and
a viaticum of his father, to goe to the Island of <i>Sancta</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span><i>Hellena</i>, purely upon the account of advancement in
Astronomy, to make the globe of the Southerne Hemisphere
right, which before was very erroneous, as being donne
only after the observations of ignorant seamen. There he
stayed ... moneths. There went over with him (amongst
others) a woman ... yeares old, and her husband ... old,
who had no child in ... yeares; before he came from the
island, she was brought to bed of a child. At his returne,
he presented his Planisphere, with a short description, to
his majesty who was very well pleased with it; but
received nothing but prayse.</p>

<p>I have often heard him say that if his majestie would be
but only at the chardge of sending out a ship, he would
take the longitude and latitude, right ascensions and
declinations of ... southern fixed starres.</p>

<p>Anno 1678, he added a spectacle-glasse to the shadowe-vane
of the lesser arch of the sea-quadrant (or back-staffe);
which is of great use, for that that spott of light will be
manifest when you cannot see any shadowe.</p>

<p>He went to Dantzick to visit Hevelius, Anno 167-.</p>

<p>December 1<sup>st</sup>, 1680, went to Paris.</p>

called the <i>earle of Northumberland's three Magi</i>. They
had a table at the earle's chardge, and the earle himselfe
had them to converse with, singly or together.</p>

<p>The bishop of Sarum (Seth Ward) told me that one
Mr. Haggar (a countryman of his), a gentleman and good
mathematician, was well acquainted with Mr. Thomas
Hariot, and was wont to say, that he did not like (or
valued not) the old storie of the Creation of the World.
He could not beleeve the old position; he would say
<i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i>. But sayd Mr. Haggar, a <i>nihilum</i> killed
him at last: for in the top of his nose came a little red
speck (exceeding small), which grew bigger and bigger,
and at last killed him. I suppose it was that which the
chirurgians call a <i>noli me tangere</i>.</p>

<p>He made a philosophicall theologie, wherin he castoff
the Old Testament, and then the New one would
(consequently) have no foundation. He was a Deist.
His doctrine he taught to Sir Walter Raleigh, Henry,

of those times look't on his manner of death as a judgement
upon him for nullifying the Scripture.</p>

(Sir ... Samuel's house in Northamptonshire) anno....</p>

<p>He was a &lt;gentleman&gt; commoner of Trinity Colledge
in Oxford. He travelled France, Italie, and the Netherlands.
His genius lay chiefly towards the politiques and
democraticall goverment.</p>

<p>He was much respected by the queen of Bohemia<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a>, who
was bred up by the lord Harrington's lady, and she owned
the kindnes of the family.</p>

<p>Anno 1647, if not 6, he was by order of Parliament
made one of his Majestie's Bedchamber, at Holmeby, &amp;c.
The king loved his company; only he would not endure
to heare of a Commonwealth: and Mr. Harington passionately
loved his majestie. Mr. Harrington and the king
often disputed about goverment. He was on the scaffold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>with the king when he was beheaded; and I have at these
meetings<a name="FNanchor_1402" id="FNanchor_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> oftentimes heard him speake of king Charles I with
the greatest zeale and passion imaginable, and that his
death gave him so great griefe that he contracted a disease
by it; that never any thing did goe so neer to him.
Memorandum:&mdash;Mr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Herbert, the traveller, was
th' other of his Bedchamber by order of Parliament, and
was also on the scaffold. He gave them both there
some watches: vide Speech.</p>

<p>He made severall essayes in Poetry, viz. love-verses, &amp;c.,
and translated ... booke of Virgill's &AElig;n.; but his
muse was rough, and Mr. Henry Nevill, an ingeniose and
well-bred gentleman, a member of the House of Commons,
and an excellent (but concealed) poet, was his great
familiar and confident friend, and disswaded him from
tampering in poetrie which he did <i>invit&acirc; Minerv&acirc;</i>, and to
improve his proper talent, viz. Politicall Reflections.</p>

<p>Whereupon he writ his <i>Oceana</i>, printed London &lt;1656&gt;.
Mr. T. Hobbes was wont to say that Henry Nevill had
a finger in that pye; and 'tis like enough. That ingeniose
tractat, together with his and H. Nevill's smart discourses and
inculcations, dayly at coffee-houses, made many proselytes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i_p289.png" width="326" height="147" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In so much that, anno 1659, the beginning of Michaelmas-terme,
he had every night a meeting at the (then) Turke's
head, in the New Pallace-yard, where they take water, the
next house to the staires, at one Miles's, where was made
purposely a large ovall-table, with a passage
in the middle for Miles to deliver his Coffee.
About it sate his disciples, and the virtuosi.
The discourses in this kind were the most ingeniose, and
smart, that ever I heard, or expect to heare, and ban&lt;i&gt;ed
with great eagernesse: the arguments in the
Parliament howse were but flatt to it.</p>

<p>He now printed a little pamphlet (4to) called <i>Divers
modells of Popular Government</i>, printed by Daniel Jakeman;
and then his partie desired him to print another little
pamphlet called <i>The Rota</i>, 4to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>Here<a name="FNanchor_1403" id="FNanchor_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> we had (very formally) a <i>ballotting-box</i>, and
balloted how things should be caried, by way of tentamens.
The room was every evening<a name="FNanchor_1404" id="FNanchor_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> full as it could be cramm'd.
I cannot now recount the whole number:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Cyriack Skinner, an ingeniose young gentleman,
scholar to John Milton, was chaire-man. There was
Mr. Henry Nevill; major John Wildman; Mr. &lt;Charles&gt;
Woo&lt;l&gt;seley, of ..., Staffordshire; Mr. &lt;Roger&gt; Coke,
grandson of Sir Edward; Sir<a name="FNanchor_1405" id="FNanchor_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> William Poultney (chaireman);

then once turn'd the councill-board of Oliver Cromwell,

<p>&lt;Besides&gt; which<a name="FNanchor_1408" id="FNanchor_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> were, as auditors<a name="FNanchor_1409" id="FNanchor_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>, severall,
e.g. the earle<a name="FNanchor_1410" id="FNanchor_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> Tirconnel; Sir John Penruddock; etc.; Mr.

<p>... Stafford, esq., as antagonists<a name="FNanchor_1411" id="FNanchor_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>.</p>

<p>Several officers<a name="FNanchor_1412" id="FNanchor_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>.</p>

<p>We many times adjourned to the Rhenish-wine howse.
One time Mr. Stafford and his gang came in, in drink,
from the taverne<a name="FNanchor_1413" id="FNanchor_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>, and affronted the Junto (Mr. Stafford
tore their orders and minutes). The soldiers offerd to
kick them downe stayres, but Mr. Harrington's moderation
and persuasion hindred it.</p>

<p>The doctrine was very taking, and the more because, as
to human foresight, there was no possibility of the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>returne. But the greatest part of the Parliament-men
perfectly hated this designe of <i>rotation by ballotting</i>; for
they were cursed tyrants, and in love with their power,
and 'twas death to them, except 8 or 10, to admitt of this
way, for H. Nevill proposed it in the Howse, and made it
out to them, that except they embraced that modell of
goverment they would be ruind&mdash;<i>sed quos perdere vult
Jupiter</i> etc., <i>hos</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pride of senators for life is insufferable; and they were
able to grind any one they owed ill will to to powder;
they were hated by the armie and their countrey they represented,
and their name and memorie stinkes&mdash;'twas
worse then tyranny. Now this modell upon rotation was:&mdash;that
the third part of the Senate<a name="FNanchor_1414" id="FNanchor_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> should rote out by ballot
every yeare, so that every ninth yeare the Howse would
be wholly alterd; no magistrate to continue above 3 yeares,
and all to be chosen by ballot, then which manner of
choice, nothing can be invented more faire and impartiall.</p>

<p>Well: this meeting continued Novemb., Dec., Jan., till
Febr. 20 or 21; and then, upon the unexpected turne
upon generall Monke's comeing-in, all these aierie modells
vanished. Then 'twas not fitt, nay treason, to have donne
such; but I well remember, he<a name="FNanchor_1415" id="FNanchor_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> severall times (at the
breaking-up) sayd, 'Well, the king will come in. Let him
come-in, and call a Parliament of the greatest Cavaliers in
England, so they be men of estates, and let them sett but
7 yeares, and they will all turn Common-wealthe's men.'</p>

<p>He was wont to find fault with the constitution of our
goverment, that 'twas <i>by jumps</i>, and told a story of
a cavaliero he sawe at the Carnival in Italie, who rode on
an excellent managed horse that with a touch of his toe
would jumpe quite round. One side of his habit was
Spanish, the other French; which sudden alteration of
the same person pleasantly surprized the spectators. 'Just
so,' said he, ''tis with us. When no Parliament, then
absolute monarchie; when a Parliament, then it runnes to
Commonwealth.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p><a name="FNanchor_1416" id="FNanchor_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>Anno Domini 1660, he was committed<a name="FNanchor_1417" id="FNanchor_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> prisoner to
the Tower, where he was kept ...; then to Portsey
castle. His durance in these prisons (he being a gentleman
of a high spirit and hot head) was the procatractique
cause of his deliration or madnesse; which was not outragious,
for he would discourse rationally enough and be
very facetious company, but he grew to have a phancy that<a name="FNanchor_1418" id="FNanchor_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>
his perspiration turned to flies, and sometimes to bees&mdash;<i>ad
c&aelig;tera sobrius</i>; and he had a timber <i>versatile</i> built<a name="FNanchor_1419" id="FNanchor_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> in
Mr. Hart's garden (opposite to St. James's parke) to try
the experiment. He would turne it to the sun, and sitt
towards it; then he had his fox-tayles there to chase
away and massacre all the flies and bees that were to be
found there, and then shutt his chassees<a name="FNanchor_1420" id="FNanchor_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>. Now this experiment
was only to be tryed in warme weather, and
some flies would lye so close in the cranies and the cloath
(with which it was hung) that they would not presently
shew themselves. A quarter of an hower after perhaps,
a fly or two, or more, might be drawen-out of the lurking
holes by the warmeth; and then he would crye out,
'Doe not you see it apparently that these come from me?'
'Twas the strangest sort of madnes that ever I found in
any one: talke of any thing els, his discourse would be
very ingeniose and pleasant.</p>

<p>Anno ... he married to his old sweet-heart Mris ...
Dayrell<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[LXXVII.]</a>, of ..., a comely and discreete ladie.
The motto to his seale, which was party per pale
baron et femme Harrington and Dayrell was....
It happening so, from some private reasons,
that he could not enjoy his deare in the flower
and heate of his youth, he would never lye
with her, but loved and admired her dearly: for she was
<i>vergentibus annis</i> when he maried her, and had lost her
sweetenesse.</p>

<p>He was of a middling stature, well-trussed man, strong
and thick, well-sett, sanguine, quick-hott-fiery hazell eie,
thick moyst curled haire, as you may see by his picture.
In his conversation very friendly, and facetious, and
hospitable.</p>

<p>For above twenty yeares before he died (except his
imprisonment) he lived in the Little-Ambry (a faire house
on the left hand), which lookes into the Deane's-yard in

commonly dined, and meditated, and tooke his tobacco.</p>

<p>All these remembrances and building was destroyed
by the generall fire.</p>

<p>He was alwayes very contemplative, and the first
that I heare of that was curious in anatomie in England.
He had made dissections of frogges, toades, and a number
of other animals, and had curious observations on them,
which papers, together with his goods, in his lodgings at
Whitehall, were plundered at the beginning of the Rebellion,
he being for the king, and with him at Oxon; but he
often sayd, that of all the losses he sustained, no greife
was so crucifying to him as the losse of these papers,
which for love or money he could never retrive or obtaine.
When Charles I<a name="FNanchor_1439" id="FNanchor_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> by reason of the tumults left London, he
attended him, and was at the fight of Edge-hill with him;
and during the fight, the Prince and duke of Yorke were
committed to his care: he told me that he withdrew with
them under a hedge, and tooke out of his pockett a booke and
read; but he had not read very long before a bullet of
a great gun grazed on the ground neare him, which
made him remove his station. He told me that Sir Adrian
Scrope<a name="FNanchor_1440" id="FNanchor_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> was dangerously wounded there, and left for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>dead amongst the dead men, stript; which happened to
be the saving of his life. It was cold, cleer weather, and
a frost that night; which staunched his bleeding, and
about midnight, or some houres after his hurt, he awaked,
and was faine to drawe a dead body upon him for warmeth-sake.</p>

<p>After Oxford was surrendred, which was 24 July<a name="FNanchor_1441" id="FNanchor_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> 1646,
he came to London, and lived with his brother Eliab
a rich<a name="FNanchor_1442" id="FNanchor_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> merchant in London, on ... hill, opposite to
St. Lawrence (Poultry) church<a name="FNanchor_1443" id="FNanchor_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>, where was then a high
leaden steeple (there were but two, viz. this and St.
Dunstan's in the East) and at his brother's country house
at Roe-hampton.</p>

<p>His brother Eliab bought, about 1654, Cockaine-house,
now<a name="FNanchor_1444" id="FNanchor_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>(1680) the Excise-Office, a noble house, where the
Doctor was wont to contemplate on the leads of the house,
and had his severall stations, in regard of the sun, or
wind.</p>

<p>He did delight to be in the darke, and told me he could
then best contemplate. He had a house heretofore at
Combe, in Surrey, a good aire and prospect, where he had
caves made in the earth, in which in summer time he
delighted to meditate.&mdash;He was pretty well versed in
the Mathematiques, and had made himselfe master of
Mr. Oughtred's Clavis Math. in his old age; and I have
seen him perusing it, and working problems, not long
before he dyed, and that booke was alwayes in his meditating
apartment.</p>

<p>His chamber was that roome that is now the office of
Elias Ashmole, esq.; where he dyed, being taken with the
dead palsye, which tooke away his speech. As soone as
he sawe he was attaqued, he presently sent for his brother,
and nephews, and gave one a watch, another another thing,
etc., as remembrances of him. He dyed worth 20,000 <i>li.</i>
which he left to his brother Eliab. In his will he left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>his old friend Mr. Thomas Hobbes 10 <i>li.</i> as a token of
his love.</p>

<p><i>His sayings.</i>&mdash;He was wont to say that man was but
a great mischievous baboon.</p>

<p>He would say, that we Europaeans knew not how to order
or governe our woemen, and that the Turkes were the only
people used them wisely.</p>

<p>He was far from bigotry.</p>

<p>He had been physitian to the Lord Chancellor Bacon,
whom he esteemed much for his witt and style, but would
not allow him to be a great philosopher. 'He writes
philosophy like a Lord Chancelor,' said he to me, speaking
in derision; 'I have cured him.'</p>

<p>About 1649 he travelled again into Italy, Dr. George
(now Sir George) Ent, then accompanying him.</p>

<p>At Oxford, he grew acquainted with Dr. Charles Scarborough,
then a young physitian (since by king Charles II
knighted), in whose conversation he much delighted; and
wheras before, he<a name="FNanchor_1445" id="FNanchor_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>marched up and downe with the army,
he tooke him to him and made him ly in his chamber, and
said to him, 'Prithee leave off thy gunning, and stay here;
I will bring thee into practice.'</p>

<p>I remember he kept a pretty young wench to wayte on
him, which I guesse he made use of for warmeth-sake as
king David did, and tooke care of her in his will, as also
of his man servant.</p>

<p>For 20 yeares before he dyed he tooke no manner of
care about his worldly concernes, but his brother Eliab,
who was a very wise and prudent menager, ordered all not
only faithfully, but better then he could have donne
himselfe.</p>

<p>He was, as all the rest of the brothers, very cholerique;
and in his young days wore a dagger (as the fashion then
was, nay I remember my old schoolemaster, old Mr. Latimer,
at 70, wore a dudgeon, with a knife, and bodkin, as also
my old grandfather Lyte, and alderman Whitson of
Bristowe, which I suppose was the common fashion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
their young dayes), but this Dr. would be to&lt;o&gt; apt to
draw-out his dagger upon every slight occasion<a name="FNanchor_1446" id="FNanchor_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>.</p>

<p>He was not tall; but of the lowest stature, round faced,
olivaster<a name="FNanchor_1447" id="FNanchor_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> complexion; little eie, round, very black, full of
spirit; his haire was black as a raven, but quite white 20
yeares before he dyed.</p>

<p>I first sawe him at Oxford, 1642, after Edgehill fight,
but was then too young to be acquainted with so great
a Doctor. I remember he came severall times to Trin.<a name="FNanchor_1448" id="FNanchor_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>
Coll. to George Bathurst, B.D., who had a hen to hatch
egges in his chamber, which they dayly opened to discerne<a name="FNanchor_1449" id="FNanchor_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>
the progres and way of generation. I had not the honour
to be acquainted &lt;with&gt; him<a name="FNanchor_1450" id="FNanchor_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> till 1651, being my she
cosen Montague's physitian and friend. I was at that
time bound for Italy (but to my great griefe disswaded by
my mother's importunity). He was very communicative,
and willing to instruct any that were modest and respectfull
to him. And in order to my journey, gave me, i.e. dictated
to me, what to see, what company to keepe, what bookes
to read<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a>, how to manage my studies: in short, he bid me
goe to the fountain head, and read Aristotle, Cicero,
Avicenna, and did<a name="FNanchor_1451" id="FNanchor_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> call the neoteriques shitt-breeches. He
wrote a very bad hand<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[ET]</a>, which (with use) I could pretty
well read.</p>

<p>I have heard him say, that after his booke of the
Circulation of the Blood<a name="FNanchor_1452" id="FNanchor_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>came-out, that he fell mightily
in his practize, and that 'twas beleeved by the vulgar that
he was crack-brained; and all the physitians were against
his opinion, and envyed him; many wrote against him, as
Dr. Primige, Paracisanus, etc. (vide Sir George Ent's
booke). With much adoe at last, in about 20 or 30 yeares
time, it was recieved in all the Universities in the world;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>and, as Mr. Hobbes sayes in his book 'De Corpore,' <i>he is
the only man, perhaps, that ever lived to see his owne doctrine
established in his life time</i>.</p>

<p>He understood Greek and Latin pretty well, but was no
critique, and he wrote very bad Latin. The <i>Circuitus
Sanguinis</i> was, as I take it, donne into Latin by Sir George
Ent (quaere), as also his booke <i>de Generatione Animalium</i>,
but a little book in 12<sup>mo</sup> against Riolani (I thinke),
wherein he makes-out his doctrine clearer, was writt by
himselfe, and that, as I take it, at Oxford.</p>

<p>His majestie king Charles I gave him the Wardenship of
Merton Colledge in Oxford, as a reward for his service,
but the times suffered him not to recieve or injoy any
benefitt by it.</p>

<p>He was physitian, and a great favorite of the Lord
High Marshall of England, Thomas<a name="FNanchor_1453" id="FNanchor_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> Howard, earle of
Arundel and Surrey, with whom he travelled as his
physitian in his ambassade to the Emperor ... at Vienna,
Anno Domini 163-. Mr. W. Hollar (who was then one
of his excellencie's gentlemen) told me that, in his voyage,
he would still be making of excursions into the woods,
makeing observations of strange trees, and plants, earths,
etc., naturalls, and sometimes like to be lost, so that my
Lord Ambassador would be really angry with him, for there
was not only danger of thieves, but also of wild beasts.</p>

<p>He was much and often troubled with the gowte, and his
way of cure was thus; he would then sitt with his legges
bare, if it were frost, on the leads of Cockaine house, putt
them into a payle of water, till he was almost dead with cold,
and betake himselfe to his stove, and so 'twas gonne.</p>

<p>He was hott-headed, and his thoughts working would
many times keepe him from sleepinge; he told me that
then his way was to rise out of his bed and walke about
his chamber in his shirt till he was pretty coole, i.e. till
he began to have a horror, and then returne to bed, and
sleepe very comfortably.</p>

<p>I remember he was wont to drinke coffee; which he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
his brother Eliab did, before Coffee-houses were in fashion
in London.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1454" id="FNanchor_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>All his profession would allowe him to be an excellent
anatomist, but I never heard of any that admired his
therapeutique way. I knew severall practisers in London<a name="FNanchor_1455" id="FNanchor_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
that would not have given 3<i>d.</i> for one of his bills; and
that a man could hardly tell by one of his bills<a name="FNanchor_1456" id="FNanchor_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> what he
did aime at.</p>

<p>He did not care for chymistrey, and was wont to speake
against them with an undervalue.</p>

<p>It is now fitt, and but just, that I should endeavour to
undecieve the world in a scandall that I find strongly
runnes of him, which I have mett amongst some learned
young men: viz. that he made himselfe a way to putt
himselfe out of his paine, by opium; not but that, had he
laboured under great paines, he had been readie enough
to have donne it; I doe not deny that it was not according
to his principles upon certain occasions to ...: but the
manner of his dyeing was really, and <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, thus, viz.
the morning of his death about 10 a clock, he went to
speake, and found he had the dead palsey in his tongue;
then he sawe what was to become of him, he knew there
was then no hopes of his recovery, so presently sends for
his young nephewes to come-up to him, to whom he gives
one his watch ('twas a minute watch with which he made
his experiments); to another, another remembrance, etc.;
made signe to ... Sambroke, his apothecary (in Black-Fryars),
to lett him blood in the tongue, which did little or
no good; and so he ended his dayes. His practise was not
very great towards his later end; he declined it, unlesse
to a speciall friend,&mdash;e.g. my lady Howland, who had
a cancer in her breast, which he did cutt-off and seared,
but at last she dyed of it.</p>

<p>He rode on horseback with a foot-cloath
to visitt his patients<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[LXXX.]</a>, his man following on
foote, as the fashion then was, which was very decent, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>quite discontinued. The judges rode also with their foote-cloathes
to Westminster-hall, which ended at the death of
Sir Robert Hyde, Lord Chief Justice. Anthony earl of
Shafton<a name="FNanchor_1457" id="FNanchor_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>, would have revived, but severall of the judges
being old and ill horsemen would not agree to it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_226" id="Footnote_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_226"><span class="label">[LXXX.]</span></a> I have seen
him ride in 1654
or 5.</p></div>

<p>Lettres on naturalls: &lt;quaere&gt; Mr. Samb&lt;roke&gt;.</p>

<p>The scandall aforesaid is from Sir Charles Scarborough's
saying that he had, towards his latter end, a preparation of
opium and I know not what, which he kept in his study
to take, if occasion should serve, to putt him out of his
paine, and which Sir Charles promised to give him; this
I beleeve to be true; but doe not at all beleeve that he
really did give it him. The palsey did give him an easie

made curious researches and anatomicall observations on

if a good bitch is first warded with a curre, let her ever
after be warded with a dog of a good straine and yet she
will bring curres as at first, her wombe being first infected
with a curre. So, the children will be like the first husband
(like raysing up children to your brother). So, the adulterer,

of Bayntun, in com. Wilts, esq. but had no issue by her.

mariage, I suppose, hastened his death. My kinswoman
was a handsome <i>bona roba</i> and ingeniose.</p>

<p>When he was first maried he lived a yeare or better at

in the spring of the yeare<a name="FNanchor_1488" id="FNanchor_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> ... the stallions ... were to
be brought before such a part of the house, where she
had a <i>vidette</i> to look on them.... One of her great
gallants was crooke-back't Cecill, earl of Salisbury.</p>

<p>In her time Wilton house was like a College, there were
so many learned and ingeniose persons. She was the
greatest patronesse of witt and learning of any lady in
her time. She was a great chymist and spent yearly
a great deale in that study. She kept for her laborator<a name="FNanchor_1489" id="FNanchor_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> in
the house Adrian Gilbert (vulgarly called Dr. Gilbert),
halfe brother to Sir Walter Ralegh, who was a great
chymist in those dayes. 'Twas he that made the curious
wall about Rowlington-parke, which is the parke that
adjoyns to the house at Wilton. Mr. Henry Sanford was
the earle's secretary, a good scholar and poet, and who
did penne part of the <i>Arcadia</i> dedicated to her (as appeares
by the preface). He haz a preface before it with the two
letters of his name. 'Tis he that haz verses before Bond's
Horace. She also gave an honourable yearly pension to
Dr. &lt;Thomas&gt; Mouffett,<a name="FNanchor_1490" id="FNanchor_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>who hath writt a booke <i>De
insectis</i>. Also one ... Boston, a good chymist, a Salisbury
man borne, who<a name="FNanchor_1491" id="FNanchor_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> did undoe himselfe by studying the
philosopher's stone, and she would have kept him but he
would have all the gold to him selfe and so dyed I thinke
in a goale.</p>

<p>At Wilton is a good library which Mr. Christopher Wase
can give you the best account of of any one; which was
collected in this learned ladie's time. There is a manuscript
very elegantly written, viz. all the Psalmes of David
translated by Sir Philip Sydney, curiously bound in crimson
velvet. There is a MS. writt by Dame Marian<a name="FNanchor_1492" id="FNanchor_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> of hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>and hawking, in English verse, written in King Henry the
8<sup>th's</sup> time (quaere Mr. Christopher Wase farther). There is
the legier book of Wilton, one page Saxon and the other
Latin, which Mr. Dugdale perused.</p>

<p>This curious seate of Wilton and the adjacent countrey
is an Arcadian place and a paradise. Sir Philip Sydney
was much here, and there was<a name="FNanchor_1493" id="FNanchor_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> ... great love between him
and his faire sister ... I have heard old gentlemen (old
Sir Walter Long of Dracot and old Mr. Tyndale) say ...
The first Philip, earle of Pembroke, ... inherited not the
witt of either the brother or sister.</p>

<p>This countesse, after her lord's death, maried<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[LXXXIV.]</a>
to Sir Matthew Lister<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[LXXXV.]</a>, knight, one of the
Colledge of Physitians, London. He was (they
say) a learned and a handsome gentleman. She
built then a curious house in Bedfordshire called Houghton
Lodge neer Ampthill. The architects were sent for from
Italie. It is built according to the description of Basilius's
house in the first booke of the <i>Arcadia</i> (which is dedicated
to her). It is most pleasantly situated and hath fower
visto's, each prospect 25 or 30 miles. This was sold to
the earle of Elgin for ... <i>li.</i> The house did cost 10,000 <i>li.</i>
the building.</p>

<h3><b>William Herbert</b>, 1st earl of Pembroke (1507-1570).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_1499" id="FNanchor_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>William<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[FB]</a>, earle of Pembroke, the first earle of that
family, was borne (I thinke I have heard my cosen Whitney
say) in ... in Monmouthshire. Herbert, of Colbrooke in
Monmouthshire, is of that family.</p>

<p>He was (as I take it) a younger brother, a mad fighting
young fellow. 'Tis certaine he was a servant to the house
of Worcester, and wore their blew-coate and badge. My
cosen Whitney's great aunt gave him a golden angell<a name="FNanchor_1500" id="FNanchor_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> when
he went to London. One time being at Bristowe, he was
arrested, and killed one of the sheriffes of the city. He
made his escape through Back-street, through the (then
great) gate, into the Marsh, and gott into France.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;upon this action of killing the sheriffe,
the city ordered the gate to be walled-up, and only a little
posterne gate or dore, with a turnestile for a foot-passenger,
which continued so till Bristowe was a garrison for the king,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>and the great gate was then opened, in 1644, or 1645.
When I was a boy there, living with my father's mother,
who was maried to alderman John Whitson<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[LXXXVI.]</a>
(who was my god-father), the story was as
fresh as but of yesterday. He was called <i>black
Will Herbert</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_243" id="Footnote_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_243"><span class="label">[LXXXVI.]</span></a> He was the
greatest benefactor
to the
city that haz
been since the
Reformacion.
He gave 500 <i>li.</i>
per annum at
least to the city
to maintain ...
blew-coates,
boies and
maydes. He
dyed about
1629; vide
register.</p></div>

<p>In France he betooke himself into the army,
where he shewd so much courage, and readinesse
of witt in conduct, that in short time he
became eminent, and was favoured by &lt;Francis
I&gt; the king, who afterwards recommended him
to Henry the VIII of England, who much valued him, and
heaped favours and honours upon him.</p>

<p>Upon the dissolution of the abbeys, he gave him the
abbey of Wilton, and a <i>country</i> of lands and mannours
thereabout belonging to it. He gave him also the abbey
of Remesbury in Wilts, with much lands belonging to it.
He gave him Cardiff-Castle in Glamorganshire, with the
ancient crowne-lands belonging to it.</p>

<p>Almost all the country held of this castle. It was
built by Sir Robert Fitzhamond the Norman, who lies
buried at Tewkesbury abbey with a memorial: and
he built the abbey of Glocester. It afterwards came
to Jasper, duke of Bedford, etc.; so to the crowne.
I have seen severall writings of Sir John Aubrey's at
Llantrithid in Glamorganshire, which beginne<a name="FNanchor_1501" id="FNanchor_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> thus:&mdash;'Ego
Jaspar, frater regum et patruus, dux Bedfordiae,
comes Pembrochiae, et dominus de Glamorgan et Morgannog,
omnibus ad quos hoc presens scriptum pervenerit,
salutem, etc.'</p>

<p>He maried &lt;Anne&gt; Par, sister of queen Katharine Par,
daughter and co-heire of &lt;Thomas&gt; Par (I thinke<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[FC]</a>, marquisse
of Northampton), by whom he had 2 sonnes, Henry,
earle of Pembroke, and &lt;Edward&gt; the ancestor of the
lord Powys.</p>

<p>He was made Privy Councellor and conservator of King
Henry the Eight's<a name="FNanchor_1502" id="FNanchor_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>will. He could neither write nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>read, but had a stamp for his name. He was of good
naturall parts; but very cholerique. He was strong sett
but bony, reddish-favoured, of a sharp eie<a name="FNanchor_1503" id="FNanchor_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>, sterne looke.</p>

<p>In queen Mary's time, upon the returne of the Catholique
religion, the nunnes came again to Wilton abbey, and this
William, earl of Pembroke, came to the gate (which lookes
towards the court by the street, but now is
walled-up) with his cappe in hand, and fell upon
his knee to the lady abbesse<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[LXXXVII.]</a> and the nunnes,
crying peccavi. Upon queen Mary's death, the
earle came to Wilton (like a tygre) and turnd
them out, crying, 'Out ye whores, to worke, to
worke, ye whores, goe spinne.'</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_244" id="Footnote_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_244"><span class="label">[LXXXVII.]</span></a> The last lady
abbesse here
was ... Gawen,
of Norrington,
belonging to
Chalke, where
that family haz
been 400 yeares
(sold about 1665
to Judge
Wadham
Windham).</p></div>

<p>He being a stranger in our country, and an upstart, was
much envyed. And in those dayes (of sword and buckler),
noblemen (and also great knights, as the <i>Longs</i>), when they
went to the assizes or sessions at Salisbury, etc., had a great
number of retainers following them; and there were (you
have heard), in those dayes, feudes (i.e. quarrells and
animosities) between great neighbours. Particularly this
new earle was much envyed by the then lord Sturton of
Sturton<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[FD]</a>, who would, when he went or returned from Sarum
(by Wilton was his rode), sound his trumpetts, and give
reproachfull challenging words; 'twas a relique of knighthood
errantry.</p>

<p>From my great-uncles, the Brownes of Broad Chalke:&mdash;in
queen Elizabeth's time, some bishop (I have forgot who)
that had been his chaplain, was sent to him from the
queen and council, to take interrogatories of him. So
he takes out his pen and inke, examines and writes.
When he had writt a good deale, sayd the earle, 'Now
lett me see it.' 'Why,' q<sup>d</sup> the bishop, 'your lordship
cannot read it?' 'That's all one: I'le see it,' q<sup>d</sup> he, and
takes it and teares it to pieces: 'Zounds, you rascall,' q<sup>d</sup>
he, 'd'ee thinke I will have my throate cutt with a penknife?'
It seemes they had a mind to have pick't a hole in
his coate, and to have gott his estate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>
<p>'Tis reported that he caused himself to be lett bloud,
and bled so much that it was his death, and that he should
say as he was expiring, 'They would have Wilton&mdash;they
would have Wilton,' and so gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>Memorandum:&mdash;this William (the founder of this family)
had a little cur-dog which loved him, and the earl loved the
dog. When the earle dyed the dog would not goe from his
master's dead body, but pined away, and dyed under the
hearse; the picture of which dog is under his picture, in
the Gallery at Wilton. Which putts me in<a name="FNanchor_1504" id="FNanchor_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>mind of
a parallell storie in Appian (Syrian Warr):&mdash;Lysimachus
being slaine, a dog that loved him stayed a long time by the
body and defended it from birds and beasts till such time as
Thorax, king of Pharsalia, finding it out gave it buriall.
And I thinke there is such another story in Pliny: vide.</p>

<p>He was buried in ... of St. Paule's, London, where he
had a magnificent monument, which is described, with the
epitaph, by Sir William Dugdale, which vide.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1505" id="FNanchor_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>This present earl of Pembroke (1680) has at Wilton

and philosopher and traveller, and a poet<a name="FNanchor_1520" id="FNanchor_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>. His writings
had the usuall fate of those not printed in the author's
life-time. He was so eminent for knowledge, that he was
the favourite of ...<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[LXXXVIII.]</a> the great earle of Oxford,
who had him to accompanie him in his travells
(he was his steward), which were so splendid
and sumptuous, that he kept at Florence a
greater court then the Great Duke. This earle
spent in that ... of travelling, the inheritance
of ten or twelve thousand pounds per annum.</p>

<p>Old Serjeant Hoskins (the poet, grandfather to this Sir

<p>In his travells with his lord, (I forget whither Italy or
Germany, but I thinke the former) a poor man begged him
to give him <i>a penny</i>. 'A penny!' said Mr. Hill, 'what dost
say to ten pound?' 'Ah! ten pound!' (said the beggar)
'that would make a man happy.' N. Hill gave him immediately
10 <i>li.</i> and putt it downe upon account,&mdash;'Item,

<h3><b>Thomas Hobbes</b> (1588-1679).</h3>


<p>&lt;This, the most elaborate of these 'Brief Lives,' occupies by itself
MS. Aubr. 9. For the letters introductory to it, see <i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>-20.</p>

<p>The various papers of which the MS. is composed are bound up
confusedly, and the separate notes are in some cases entered on a page,
or a page and its opposite, in no order. Considerable re-arrangement
has therefore been necessary; but the exact MS. references have
been given throughout. Some few notes relating to Hobbes, found
in other Aubrey MSS., have here been brought into their natural
place.&gt;</p>

dyed about two yeares after his father, and left five

<h4>&lt;<i>Description of Malmsbury.</i>&gt;</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;As may be seen from his intended preface (<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>) Aubrey
thought of beginning the life of Hobbes with an account of Malmsbury.</p>

<p>For this purpose in MS. Aubr. 9 he has drawn three plans<a name="FNanchor_1566" id="FNanchor_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) plan of environs of Malmsbury (a slip at fol. 31<sup>v</sup>).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
<p>(b) plan of Malmsbury (fol. 31<sup>v</sup>).</p>

<p>(c) a drawing of the house in which Hobbes was born (fol. 31<sup>v</sup>).
These are reproduced in facsimile at the end of this edition.</p>

<p>He gives there (fol. 31<sup>v</sup>) these dimensions of the town:&mdash;'From
St. John's Bridge &lt;south limit of the town&gt; to the abbey &lt;north&gt; is
about a quarter of a mile; and from the same bridge to Westport
church &lt;west limit&gt; is neer about a mile. Height of the borough from
the levill belowe is about 100 foot high.'</p>

<p>The references on the plan of Malmsbury (see the facsimile) are:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>'&alpha; = the house of his birth.</li>
<li>&omega; = Westport church.</li>
<li>W = the West port (<i>olim</i>).</li>
<li>&beta; = the smyth's shop.</li>
<li>&delta; = the private house where Mr. Latimer taught him.</li>
<li>&xi; = Three Tunnes (as I take it), opposite to the smyth's shop.</li>

</ul>

<p>On fol. 31<sup>v</sup> of MS. Aubr. 9, Aubrey has these remarks about these
plans, etc.:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If these notes are not now inserted, probably they will be lost: or
should it not be a marginall commentary?'</p>

<p>'I have drawne this rude sketch meerly for your clearer understanding,

<h4>&lt;<i>Description of Westport.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1568" id="FNanchor_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>Westport<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[FJ]</a> is the parish without the west-gate (which
is now demolished), which gate stood on the neck of land
that joines Malmesbury (vide verses<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[FK]</a>) to Westport. Here<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[FL]</a>
was, before the late warres, a very pretty church, consisting
of 3 aisles, or rather a nave and two aisles (which
tooke up the whole area<a name="FNanchor_1569" id="FNanchor_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>), dedicated to St. Mary; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>a fair spire-steeple, with five tuneable bells, which, when the
towne was taken (about 1644; quaere William Aubrey)
by Sir W. Waller, were converted<a name="FNanchor_1570" id="FNanchor_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> into ordinance, and the
church pulled-downe to the ground, that the enemie might
not shelter themselves against the garrison. The steeple
was higher then that now standing in the borough, which
much added to<a name="FNanchor_1571" id="FNanchor_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> the prospect. The windowes were well
painted, and in them were inscriptions that declared much
antiquitie; now is here rebuilt a church like a stable.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>Place and date of his birth.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>Thomas Hobbes, Malmesburiensis, Philosophus, was borne
at his father's house in Westport, being that extreme howse
that pointes into, or<a name="FNanchor_1572" id="FNanchor_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> faces, the Horse-fayre; the farthest
howse on the left hand as you goe to Tedbury, leaving the
church on your right. To prevent mistakes, and that hereafter
may rise no doubt<a name="FNanchor_1573" id="FNanchor_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> what house was famous for this
famous man's birth; I doe here testifie that in April, 1659,
his brother Edmond went with me into this house, and into
the chamber where he was borne. Now things begin to be
antiquated, and I have heard some guesse it might be at
the howse where his brother Edmund lived and dyed.
But this is so, as I here<a name="FNanchor_1574" id="FNanchor_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> deliver it. This house was given
by Thomas, the vicar, to his daughter<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[XCVII.]</a> ... whose
daughter or granddaughter possessed<a name="FNanchor_1575" id="FNanchor_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a>
it, when I was there.<a name="FNanchor_1576" id="FNanchor_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>It is a firme house, stone-built
and tiled, of one roome (besides<a name="FNanchor_1577" id="FNanchor_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> a buttery, or the like,
within) below, and two chambers above. 'Twas in the
innermost where he first drew breath.</p>

see in Origanus, etc., and Oliver Cromwell had so, etc.</p>


<h4>&lt;<i>His school and college life.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>At four yeares old<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[FO]</a> he went to schoole in Westport
church, till eight; by that time<a name="FNanchor_1584" id="FNanchor_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> he could read well, and
number four figures. Afterwards he went to schoole to
Malmesbury, to Mr. Evans, the minister of the towne;
and afterwards to Mr. Robert Latimer, a young man of
about nineteen or twenty, newly come from the University,
who then kept a private schoole in Westport, where the
broad place (quaere nomen) is, next dore north from the
smyth's shop, opposite to the Three Cuppes<a name="FNanchor_1585" id="FNanchor_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> (as I take it).
He was a batchelour and delighted in his scholar, T. H.'s
company, and used to instruct him, and two or three
ingeniose youths more, in the evening till nine a clock.
Here T. H. so well profited in his learning, that at fourteen
yeares of age, he went away a good schoole-scholar to
Magdalen-hall, in Oxford. It is not to be forgotten, that
before he went to the University, he had turned Euripidis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>Medea<a name="FNanchor_1586" id="FNanchor_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> out of Greeke into Latin Iambiques, which he
presented to his master. Mr. H. told me that he would faine
have had them, to have seen how he did grow in....
Twenty odde<a name="FNanchor_1587" id="FNanchor_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> yeares agoe I searcht all old Mr. Latimer's
papers, but could not find them; the<a name="FNanchor_1588" id="FNanchor_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> good huswives
had sacrificed them.</p>

<p>I have heard his brother Edmund and Mr. Wayte (his
schoolefellowe) say that when he was a boy he was
playsome enough, but withall he had even then a contemplative
melancholinesse; he would gett him into a
corner, and learne his lesson by heart presently. His
haire was black, and his schoolfellows<a name="FNanchor_1589" id="FNanchor_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> were wont to call
him 'Crowe.'</p>

<p>This Mr. Latimer was a good Graecian, and the first
that came into our parts hereabout since the Reformation.
He was afterwards minister of Malmesbury, and from
thence preferred to a better living of 100 <i>li.</i> per annum,
or +, at Leigh-de-la-mere within this hundred.</p>

<p>At Oxford Mr. T. H. used, in the summer time especially,
to rise very early in the morning, and would tye the leaden-counters
(which they used in those dayes at Christmas,
at post and payre) with pacthreds<a name="FNanchor_1590" id="FNanchor_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>, which he did besmere
with<a name="FNanchor_1591" id="FNanchor_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> birdlime, and bayte them with parings of cheese, and
the jack-dawes would spye them a vast distance up in the
aire<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[XCIX.]</a> and as far as Osney-abbey, and strike at
the bayte, and so be harled in the string,
which the wayte of the counter would make
cling about ther wings. He did not much
care for logick, yet he learnd it, and thought himselfe a
good disputant. He tooke great delight there to goe to
the<a name="FNanchor_1592" id="FNanchor_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> booke-binders' shops, and lye gaping on mappes, of
which he takes notice in his life written by himselfe in
verse:</p>

1603, at what time, Dr. James Hussee, LL.D., was
principall. This James Hussee was afterwards knighted
by king James and was made Chancellour of Sarum.
This Dr. Hussee was a great encourager of towardly youths.
But he resigning his principallity about 1605, Mr. John
Wilkinson succeeded him: so that Mr. Hobs was under
the government of two principalls.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[FP]</a>&mdash;Thomas Hobs was

to the degree of Bachelaur of Arts, 5 Feb., 1607<a name="FNanchor_1598" id="FNanchor_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>, and

<h4>&lt;<i>Enters the earl of Devonshire's service.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1600" id="FNanchor_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>After he had taken his batchelor of Arts degree
(quaere A. Wood de hoc), the than principall of Magdalen-hall
(Sir James Hussey<a name="FNanchor_1601" id="FNanchor_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>) recommended him to his yong
lord when he left Oxon, who had a conceit<a name="FNanchor_1602" id="FNanchor_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> that he should
profitt more in his learning if he had a scholar of his owne
age to wayte on him then if he had the information of
a grave doctor. He was his lordship's page, and rode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>a hunting and hawking with him, and kept his privy-purse.</p>

<p>By this way of life he had almost forgott his Latin;
vide Latin verses. He therefore<a name="FNanchor_1603" id="FNanchor_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> bought him bookes of
an Amsterdam print that he might carry in his pocket
(particularly Caesar's Commentarys), which he did read
in the lobbey, or ante-chamber, whilest his lord was making

<h4>&lt;<i>Is servant to Francis Bacon.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p>The Lord Chancellour Bacon loved to converse<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[C.]</a> with him.
He assisted his lordship in translating severall of
his Essayes into Latin, one, I well remember,
is<a name="FNanchor_1604" id="FNanchor_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> that <i>Of the Greatnes of Cities</i>: the rest
I have forgott. His lordship was a very contemplative
person, and was wont to contemplate in his delicious
walkes at Gorambery<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[FQ]</a>, and dictate to Mr. Thomas
Bushell, or some other of his gentlemen, that attended him
with inke and paper ready to sett downe presently his
thoughts. His lordship would often say that he better
liked Mr. Hobbes's taking his thoughts<a name="FNanchor_1605" id="FNanchor_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>, then any of the
other, because he understood what he wrote, which the
others not understanding, my Lord<a name="FNanchor_1606" id="FNanchor_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> would many times

time that ever I had the honour to see this
worthy, learned man, who was then pleased to
take notice of me, and the next day visited<a name="FNanchor_1611" id="FNanchor_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> my
relations<a name="FNanchor_1612" id="FNanchor_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>. He was then a proper man, briske,
and in very good habit<a name="FNanchor_1613" id="FNanchor_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>. His hayre was then
quite black<a name="FNanchor_1614" id="FNanchor_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>. He stayed at Malmsbury and

on geometry; which happened accidentally. Being in a
gentleman's library in ..., Euclid's Elements lay open,
and 'twas the 47 El.<a name="FNanchor_1618" id="FNanchor_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> libri I. He read the proposition.
By<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[CIII.]</a> G&mdash;,' sayd he, 'this is impossible!' So
he reads the demonstration of it, which referred
him back to such a proposition; which proposition
he read. That referred him back to another, which
he also read. Et sic deinceps, that at last he was demonstratively
convinced of that trueth. This made him in
love with geometry.</p>

<p>I have heard Sir Jonas Moore (and others<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[FR]</a>) say
that 'twas a great pity he had not began the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>the mathematics sooner, for such a working head<a name="FNanchor_1620" id="FNanchor_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> would
have made great advancement in it. So had he donne<a name="FNanchor_1621" id="FNanchor_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>,
he would not have layn so open to his learned mathematicall

would often complain that algebra<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[CIV.]</a> (though
of great use) was too much admired, and so
followed after, that it made men not contemplate
and consider so much the nature and power
of lines, which was a great hinderance to the
groweth of geometrie; for that though algebra did rarely
well and quickly, and easily in right lines, yet 'twould not

(of St. David's) preach'd <i>his doctrine</i>; for which, among
others, he was sent prisoner to the Tower. Then thought
Mr. Hobbes, 'tis time now for me to shift for my selfe,
and so withdrew<a name="FNanchor_1636" id="FNanchor_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> into France, and resided<a name="FNanchor_1637" id="FNanchor_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> at Paris. As
I remember, there were others<a name="FNanchor_1638" id="FNanchor_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> likewise did preach his
doctrine. This little MS. treatise grew to be<a name="FNanchor_1639" id="FNanchor_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> his book
<i>De Cive</i><a name="FNanchor_1640" id="FNanchor_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>, and at last grew there to be the so formidable
and ... <span class="smcap">Leviathan</span>; the manner of writing of which
booke (he told me) was thus. He walked much and
contemplated, and he had in the head of his staffe<a name="FNanchor_1641" id="FNanchor_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> a pen
and inke-horne, carried alwayes a note-booke in his pocket,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>and as soon as a thought<a name="FNanchor_1642" id="FNanchor_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> darted, he presently entred it
into his booke, or otherwise he might<a name="FNanchor_1643" id="FNanchor_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> perhaps have lost it.
He had drawne the designe of the booke into chapters,
etc. so he knew whereabout it would come in. Thus that
booke was made.</p>

<p>'He wrote and published the Leviathan far from the
intention either of disadvantage to his majestie, or to flatter
Oliver (who was not made Protector till three or four
yeares after) on purpose to facilitate his returne; for there
is scarce a page in it that he does not upbraid him.'&mdash;<i>Mr.
Hobbes considered</i>, p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1644" id="FNanchor_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>''Twas written in the behalfe of the faithfull subjects
of his majestie, that had taken his part in the war, or
otherwise donne their utmost endeavour to defend his
majestie's right and person against the rebells: wherby,
having no other meanes of protection, nor (for the most
part) of subsistence, were forced to compound with your
masters, and to promise obedience for the saving of their
lives and fortunes, which, in his booke he hath affirmed,
they might lawfully doe, and consequently not bear arms
against the victors. They had done their utmost endeavour
to performe their obligation to the king, had done all they
could be obliged unto; and were consequently at liberty
to seeke the safety of their lives and livelihood wheresoever,
and without treachery.'&mdash;&lt;ibid.&gt; p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>.</p>

<p>'His majestie was displeased with him' (at Paris) 'for
a while, but not very long, by means of some's complayning
of and misconstruing his writing. But his majestie had
a good opinion of him, and sayd openly that he thought
Mr. Hobbes never meant him hurt.'&mdash;p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.</p>

<p>'Before his booke <i>De Homine</i> came forth, nothing of the
optiques writt intelligibly. As for the Optiques of Vitellio<a name="FNanchor_1645" id="FNanchor_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>,
and several others, he accounts them rather geometry than
optiques.'&mdash;p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>. [Will not this p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a> more aptly come in
in another place?]</p>

<p>'So also of all other arts; not every one that brings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>from beyond seas a new gin, or other janty devise, is
therfore a philosopher. For if you reckon that way, not
only apothecaries and gardiners, but many other sorts of
workmen will put-in for, and get the prize&mdash;</p>

<p>'Then,<a name="FNanchor_1646" id="FNanchor_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> when I see the gentlemen of Gresham Colledge
apply themselves to the doctrine of motion (as Mr. Hobbes
has done, and will be ready to helpe them in it, if they
please, and so long as they use him civilly), I will looke
to know some causes of naturall events from them, and
their register, and not before; for nature does nothing but
by motion.</p>

<p>'The reason given by him, why the drop of glasse so much
wondred at shivers into so many pieces by breaking only
one small part of it, is approved for probable by the Royall
Societie and registred in their colledge:<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[CV.]</a> but

<p>'Then for his morosity and peevishnesse, with which
some asperse him, all that know him familiarly, know the
contrary. 'Tis true that when vain and ignorant young
scholars, unknowne to him before, come to him on purpose

<p>There was a report<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[CXIII.]</a> (and surely true) that in

some of the bishops made a motion to have
the good old gentleman burn't for a heretique.
Which he hearing, feared that his papers might be
search't by their order, and he told me he had burn't
part of them.&mdash;I have received word<a name="FNanchor_1666" id="FNanchor_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> from his amanuensis
and executor that he 'remembers there were such

knowing<a name="FNanchor_1675" id="FNanchor_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> his majestie was a great lover of good painting
I must needs presume he could not but suddenly see

<p>It happened, about two or three dayes after his majestie's
happy returne, that, as he was passing in his coach
through the Strand, Mr. Hobbes was standing at Little
Salisbury-house gate (where his lord then lived). The
king espied him, putt of his hatt very kindly to him, and
asked him how he did. About a weeke after he had<a name="FNanchor_1678" id="FNanchor_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> orall

have free accesse to his majesty, who was always much
delighted in his witt and smart repartees.</p>

<p>The witts at Court were wont to bayte him. But he
feared none of them<a name="FNanchor_1682" id="FNanchor_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>, and would make his part

<p>1664. In<a name="FNanchor_1693" id="FNanchor_1693"></a><a href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> 1664 I sayd to him 'Me thinkes 'tis pitty that

with such a long and difficult taske. I then presented him
the lord chancellor Bacon's Elements of the Lawe (a thin
quarto), in order therunto and to drawe him on; which he
was pleased to accept, and perused; and the next time I
came to him he shewed me therin two cleare paralogismes in

Hobbes's correspondent, with all that had passed; J. A.
acquaints Mr. Hobbes. Mr. Hobbes takeing it ill, was
resolved to vindicate himselfe in an Epistle to the Author.
Accordingly an epistle, dated Apr. 20, 1674, was sent to
the author in MS., with an intention to publish it when the
History of Oxford was to be published. Upon the reciept
of Mr. Hobbes's Epistle by Anthony &agrave; Wood, he forthwith
repaired, very honestly and without any guile, to the dean
of Christ Church to communicate it to him<a name="FNanchor_1726" id="FNanchor_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>. The deane
read it over carelesly, and not without scorne, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>he had donne, bid Mr. Wood tell Mr. Hobbes, 'that he
was an old man, had one foote in the grave, that he should
mind his latter end, and not trouble the world any more
with his papers,' etc., or to that effect.</p>

<p>In the meane time Mr. Hobbes meetes with the king
in the Pall-mall, in St. James's parke; tells him how he
had been served by the deane of Christ Church, in a booke
then in the presse (scilicet the 'History' aforesayd), intituled
the History and Antiquities of the Universitie of
Oxon, and withall desires his majestie to be pleased
to give him leave to vindicate himselfe. The king seeming
to be troubled at the dealing of the deane, gave Mr. Hobbes
leave, conditionally that he touch no-body but him who
had abused him, neither that he should reflect upon the
Universitie.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbes understanding that this History would be
published at the common Act at Oxon, about 11 July,
the said yeare 1674, prints his Epistle<a name="FNanchor_1727" id="FNanchor_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> at London, and
sends downe divers copies to Oxon, which being dispersed
at coffee-houses and stationers' shops, a copie forthwith
came to the deane's hands, who upon the reading of it
fretted and fumed<a name="FNanchor_1728" id="FNanchor_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>, sent<a name="FNanchor_1729" id="FNanchor_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> for the author of the History
and chid him, telling withall that he had corresponded
with his enemie (Hobbes). The author replied that surely
he had forgot what he had donne, for he had communicated
to him before what Mr. Hobbes had sayd and written;
wherupon the deane recollecting himselfe, told him that
Hobbes should suddenly heare more of him<a name="FNanchor_1730" id="FNanchor_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>; so that

But 'tis supposed it might be the cause why Mr. Hobbes
was not afterwards so indulgent, or spared the lesse to
speake his opinion, concerning the Universities and how
much their doctrine and method had contributed to the
late troubles [e.g. in his History of the Civill Warre].</p>

<p>From forty, or better, he grew healthier, and then he
had a fresh, ruddy, complexion. He was <i>sanguineo-melancholicus</i>;
which the physiologers say is the most
ingeniose complexion. He would say that 'there might be
good witts of all complexions; but good-natured, impossible.'</p>

<p><i>Head.</i> In his old age he was very bald<a name="FNanchor_1751" id="FNanchor_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> (which claymed
a veneration); yet within dore, he used to study, and sitt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>bare-headed, and sayd he never tooke cold in his head,
but that the greatest trouble was to keepe-off the flies
from pitching on the baldnes. His head was ... inches
in compasse (I have the measure), and of a mallet-forme
(approved by the physiologers).</p>

humour<a name="FNanchor_1754" id="FNanchor_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>, he affected not at all austerity and gravity and

<p><a name="FNanchor_1758" id="FNanchor_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a><i>Eie.</i> He had a good eie, and that of a hazell colour,
which was full of life and spirit, even to the last. When

he was serious and positive<a name="FNanchor_1760" id="FNanchor_1760"></a><a href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>, he open'd his eies round (i.e.
his eie-lids). He had midling eies, not very big, nor very
little (from Sir W&lt;illiam&gt; P&lt;etty&gt;).</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1761" id="FNanchor_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a><i>Stature.</i> He was six foote high, and something
better (quaere James Wh&lt;eldon&gt;), and went indifferently
erect, or rather, considering his great age, very erect.</p>

<p><i>Sight; witt.</i> His sight and witt continued to the last.
He had a curious sharp sight, as he had a sharpe witt,
which was also so sure and steady (and contrary to that
men call <i>bro&lt;a&gt;dwittednes</i>) that I have heard him oftentimes
say that in<a name="FNanchor_1762" id="FNanchor_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>multiplying and dividing he<a name="FNanchor_1763" id="FNanchor_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> never

as other men, he<a name="FNanchor_1768" id="FNanchor_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> should have knowne no more then other

<p><a name="FNanchor_1773" id="FNanchor_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a><i>Temperance and diet.</i> He was, even in his youth,
(generally) temperate, both as to wine and women, (et
tamen haec omnia mediocriter)&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.</p>

<p>I have heard him say that he did beleeve he had been
in excesse<a name="FNanchor_1774" id="FNanchor_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> in his life, a hundred times; which, considering
his great<a name="FNanchor_1775" id="FNanchor_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> age, did not amount to above once a yeare.
When he did drinke, he would drinke to excesse to have
the benefitt of vomiting, which he did easily; by which
benefit neither his witt was disturbt longer then he was
spuing nor his stomach oppressed; but he never was, nor
could not endure to be, habitually a good fellow, i.e. to
drinke every day wine with company, which, though not to
drunkennesse, spoiles the braine.</p>

<p>For his last 30+ yeares, his dyet, etc., was very moderate
and regular. After sixty he dranke no wine, his stomach
grew weak, and he did eate most fish, especially whitings,
for he sayd he digested fish better then flesh. He rose
about seaven, had<a name="FNanchor_1776" id="FNanchor_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> his breakefast of bread and butter; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>tooke his walke, meditating till ten; then he did putt
downe the minutes of his thoughts, which he penned in
the afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1777" id="FNanchor_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>He had an inch thick board about 16 inches square,
whereon paper was pasted. On this board he drew his
lines (schemes). When a line came into his head, he
would, as he was walking, take a rude memorandum of
it, to preserve it in his memory till he came to his
chamber. &#9758; He was never idle; his thoughts were
always working.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1778" id="FNanchor_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a>His dinner was provided for him exactly by eleaven,
for he could not now stay till his lord's howre&mdash;scil. about
two: that his stomach could not beare.</p>

<p>After dinner he tooke a pipe of tobacco, and then threw
himselfe immediately on his bed, with his band off, and
slept (tooke a nap of about halfe an howre).</p>

<p>In the afternoon he penned his morning thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Exercises.</i> Besides his dayly walking, he did twice or
thrice a yeare play at tennis<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[CXXII.]</a> (at about 75 he
did it); then went to bed there and was well
rubbed<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[CXXIII.]</a>. This he did believe would make him
live two or three yeares the longer.</p>

and take a care of him, which he did performe to him living
and dying, with great respect and diligence: for which
consideration he made him his executor.</p>

<p><i>Habit.</i> In cold weather he commonly wore a black
velvet coate, lined with furre; if not, some other coate so
lined. But all the yeare he wore a kind of bootes<a name="FNanchor_1781" id="FNanchor_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> of

<p><i>Singing.</i> He had alwayes bookes of prick-song lyeing
on his table:&mdash;e.g. of H. Lawes' etc. <i>Songs</i>&mdash;which at
night, when he was abed, and the dores made fast, and
was sure nobody heard him, he sang aloud (not that he
had a very good voice) but<a name="FNanchor_1782" id="FNanchor_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> for his health's sake: he did

<h4>&lt;<i>Slanders concerning him.</i>&gt;</h4>

<p><i>Aspersions and envy.</i> His work was attended with envy,
which threw severall aspersions and false reports on him.
For instance, one (common) was that he was afrayd to lye
alone at night in his chamber, [I have often heard him say
that he was not afrayd of of <i>sprights</i>, but afrayd of being
knockt on the head<a name="FNanchor_1791" id="FNanchor_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> for five or ten pounds, which rogues
might thinke he had<a name="FNanchor_1792" id="FNanchor_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> in his chamber]; and severall other
tales, as untrue.</p>

<p>I have heard some positively affirme that he had a
yearly pension from the king of France,&mdash;possibly for
having asserted such a monarchie as the king of France
exercises, but for what other grounds I know not, unles it
be for that the present<a name="FNanchor_1793" id="FNanchor_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> king of France is reputed an
encourager of choice and able men in all faculties who
can contribute to his greatnes. I never heard him speake
of any such thing; and, since his death, I have inquired of
his most intimate friends in Derbyshire, who write to me
they never heard of any such thing. Had it been so, he,
nor they, ought to have been ashamed of it, and it had
been becoming the munificence of so great a prince to
have donne it.</p>

<p><i>Atheisme<a name="FNanchor_1794" id="FNanchor_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a>.</i> Testimonie<a name="FNanchor_1795" id="FNanchor_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>. For his being branded with

No man hath written better of ..., perhaps not so well.
To prevent such false and malicious reports, I thought fit
to insert and affirme as abovesayd.<a name="FNanchor_1797" id="FNanchor_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>And that he was

paragraph of his sicknesse and death.</p>

<p>&lt;From&gt; Elizabeth, viscountesse Purbec. When Mr. T.
Hobbes was sick in France, the divines came to him,
and tormented him (both Roman Catholic, Church of
England, and Geneva). Sayd he to them 'Let me alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>or els I will detect all your cheates from Aaron to yourselves.'
I thinke I have heard him speake something to this

<p>Mr. Edmund Waller sayd to me, when I desired him
to write some verses in praise of him, that he was afrayd
of the churchmen: he quoted Horace&mdash;</p>

<p>that, what was chiefly to be taken notice of in his elogie
was that he, being but <i>one</i>, and a private person, pulled-downe

<p>His Latin <i>Leviathan</i> is altered in many particulars, e.g.
the doctrine of the Trinity, etc., and enlarged with many

<p>'In Hobbesii libris eorum quae de cive et civitate agunt (nam

quidem nomine prae caeteris laudandus est cum nemo politicorum
ante illum id ausus fuerit), <i>specialis</i> est dirigere principia sua ad

Quod vero maxime sapere videtur, id vel <i>securitatem</i> dixeris vel

hunc animum ejus ex eo patet quod superius diximus, ipsum sacra

though the house refuse them they are not lost. You

<p>I am very glad to hear you are well and continue
your favours towards me.</p>

<p>'Tis a long time since I have been able to write my selfe,
and am now so weake that it is a paine to me to dictate.</p>

<p>But yet I cannot choose but thanke you for this letter of
Jan. 25<sup>th</sup> which I receaved not till the last of ffebruary.
I was assured a good while since that Dr. Wallis his
learning is no where esteemed but in the Universities by
such as have engaged themselves in the defence of his
geometry and are now ashamed to recant it. And I
wonder not if Dr. Wallis, or any other, that have studyed
mathematicks onely to gaine preferment, when his ignorance
is discovered, convert his study to jugling and to
the gaining of a reputation of conjuring, decyphering, and
such arts<a name="FNanchor_1948" id="FNanchor_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> as are in the booke<a name="FNanchor_1949" id="FNanchor_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> you sent me.</p>

<p>As for the matter it selfe, I meane the teaching of a man
borne deafe and dumbe to speake, I thinke it impossible.
But I doe not count him deafe and indocible that can
heare a word spoken as loud as is possible at the very
entrance to his eare, for of this I am assured that a man

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;Hobbes' letter to Crooke is found as fol. 11 of MS. Aubr. 9: the
enclosure to Aubrey, as foll. 12, 13. Both are in James Wheldon's
handwriting.</p>

<p>It appears by the post-stamps on the backs of these letters that the
charge for a letter was 3<i>d.</i>, with 3<i>d.</i> for each enclosure. Thus the
letters of Aug. 18, 1679, March 5, 1679/80, Sept. 7, 1680, are all marked as
costing 3<i>d.</i> postage (MS. Aubr. 9, foll. 15<sup>v</sup>, 10<sup>v</sup>, 21<sup>v</sup>); while this letter
to Crooke, with its enclosure, cost 6<i>d.</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, fol. 11<sup>v</sup>); and the letter
of Jan. 16, 1679/80, with its two enclosures, cost 9<i>d.</i> (<i>ibid.</i> fol. 17<sup>v</sup>).&gt;</p></div>

and I pray you to present unto him my most humble

drawn on by the easinesse of the style and elegance of the

rather his good nature then my merit. I am sorry for the

<p>I have been told that my booke of the Civill Warr is

Worthy Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>Having been abroad about businesse for some days,
I receaved, at my coming home, your letter of the third of
this month, which evidences the great esteeme you have for
Mr. Hobbes, for which I returne you my humble thanks,
and particularly for the paines you have been pleased
to take in the large account of what you your selfe,
Mr. Anthony a Wood, and Sir George Ent designe for
Mr. Hobbes his honour.</p>

<p>I am glad Mr. Crooke has receaved his Life in Prose,
which was the onely thing Mr. Halleley got possession of,
and sent it to him<a name="FNanchor_1966" id="FNanchor_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a> by my hand. Mr. Halleley tells me now,
that Mr. Hobbes (in the time of his sicknesse) told him he
had promised it to Mr. Crooke, but said he was unwilling
it should ever be published as written by himselfe; and I
beleeve it was some such motive, which made him burne
those Latine verses Mr. Crooke sent him about that time.</p>

<p>For those Latine verses you mention about Ecclesiasticall
Power, I remember them, for I writ them out, but know
not what became of them, unlesse he presented them to
judge Vaughan, or burned them, as you seem to intimate.</p>

<p>He fell sick about the middle<a name="FNanchor_1967" id="FNanchor_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> October last. His
disease was the strangury, and the physitians judged it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>incurable by reason of his great age and naturall decay.
About the 20<sup>th</sup> of November, my Lord being to remove
from Chatsworth to Hardwick, Mr. Hobbes would not be
left behind; and therefore with a fether bed laid into the
coach, upon which he lay warme clad, he was conveyed
safely, and was in appearance as well after that little journey
as before it. But seven or eight days after, his whole right
side was taken with the dead palsy, and at the same time
he was made speechlesse. He lived after this seven days,
taking very little nourishment, slept well, and by intervalls
endeavoured to speake, but could not. In the whole time
of his sicknesse he was free from fever. He seemed therefore
to dye rather for want of the fuell of life (which was
spent in him) and meer weaknesse and decay, then by the
power of his disease, which was thought to be onely an effect
of his age and weaknesse. He was born the 5th of Aprill, in
the year 1588, and died the 4th of December, 1679. He was
put into a woollen shroud and coffin, which was covered
with a white sheet, and upon that a black herse cloth, and
so carryed upon men's shoulders, a little mile to<a name="FNanchor_1968" id="FNanchor_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> church.
The company, consisting of the family and neighbours that
came to his funerall, and attended him to his grave, were
very handsomely entertained with wine, burned and raw,
cake, biscuit, etc. He was buried in the parish church of
Hault Hucknall, close adjoining to the raile of the monument
of the grandmother of the present earle of Devonshire, with
the service of the Church of England by the minister of the
parish. It is intended to cover his grave with a stone of
black marble as soon as it can be got ready, with a plain
inscription of his name, the place of his birth, and the time
of that and of his death.</p>

<p>As to his will, it is sent up to London to be proved there,
and by the copy of it, which I here send you, I beleeve you
will judge it fitt to make no mention of it in<a name="FNanchor_1969" id="FNanchor_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a>what you
designe to get written by way of Commentary on his life.</p>

<p>As for the palsey in his hands, it began in ffrance, before
the year 1650, and has grown upon him by degrees ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>since; but Mr. Halleley remembers not how long it has
disabled him to write legibly.</p>

<p>Mr. Halleley never heard of a pension from the ffrench
king and beleeves there was no such thing ever intended.
He desires you to accept of his thanks for your favourable
remembrance of him, and of the returne of his respects to
you by me. And if hereafter you should want any thing
which we know, that might contribute<a name="FNanchor_1970" id="FNanchor_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> to the honour of
Mr. Hobbes's memory, upon the least notice, shall readily
be imparted to you.</p>

<p>In the mean time, with much respect, I rest,</p>

<p>

<p>The 25th day of September in the 29th year of the raigne
of our Soveraigne Lord, King Charles the Second, and in
the yeare of our Lord God, 1677.</p>

<p>I, Thomas Hobbes, of Malmesbury, in the county of
Wilts, gent. make this my last Will and Testament.</p>

<p>First, I bequeath to Mary Tirell, daughter of my deceased
brother, Edmund Hobbes, forty pounds. Item, I bequeath
to Elenor Harding, daughter also of my deceased brother,
Edmund Hobbes, forty pounds. Item, I bequeath to Elizabeth
Alaby, the daughter of Thomas Alaby, two hundred
pounds, and because she is an orphan, and committed by
me to the tuition of my executor, my will is, that she should
be maintained decently by my executor, till she be 16 yeares
of age, and that then the said two hundred pounds be
delivered into her hands, being intended for her furtherance
in marriage, but let her dispose of it as she please; and if it
happen that the said Elizabeth Alaby die before she come
to the age of 16 yeares, then my will is, that the said 200 <i>li.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>be divided equally between the said Mary Tirell and Elenor
Harding.</p>

<p>Item, whereas it hath pleased my good lord, the earle
of Devonshire, to bid me oftentimes heretofore, and now at
the making of this my last will, to dispose therein of one
hundred pounds, to be paid by his lordship, for which
I give him most humble thanks; I doe give and dispose of
the same in this manner: There be five grand-children of my
brother, Edmund Hobbes, to the eldest whereof, whose name
is Thomas Hobbes, I have heretofore given a peece of land,
which may and doth, I think, content him, and therefore to
the other four that are younger, I dispose of the same 100 <i>li.</i>
the gift of my lord of Devonshire, to be divided equally
amongst them, as a furtherance to bind them apprentices.</p>

<p>And I make and ordaine James Wheldon, servant to the
earle of Devonshire, my executor, to whom I give the
residue of my money and goods whatsoever; and because
I would have him in some sort contented for the great
service he hath done me, I would pray his majestie to what
I left him to add the arreare of my pension, or as much of
it as it pleases his majestie.</p>

<h5>viii. <i>Hon. Charles Hatton to William Crooke.</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lt;MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 26. The letter is written by a secretary, the
signature C. Hatton being in a different hand. Crooke has endorsed
it (fol. 27<sup>v</sup>) 'Mr. Hatton's letter about Mr. Hobs': to which Aubrey
has added 'scil. the lord Hatton's son.' On fol. 27 is a note, probably
by Crooke, of the 'tracts' referred to, viz. 'Life<a name="FNanchor_1989" id="FNanchor_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a>, Rheto&lt;ric&gt;<a name="FNanchor_1990" id="FNanchor_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a>, Considerations<a name="FNanchor_1991" id="FNanchor_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a>,

<p>
<a name="FNanchor_1993" id="FNanchor_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a>Mr. Crooke,<br />
</p>

<p>I thanke you for the perusall of Mr. Hobbs his tracts
which wase a civility I did not expect or desire, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>I wou'd not have you at any time deliver any booke to any
person who comes in my name unless he then payes you
for it. I did desire only to know exactly the particular price
of each tract bound apart in marble'd leather, guilt on the
backe and ribbed, which pray send me by the bearer by
whom I returne you your booke.</p>

<p>I have cursorily looked over Mr. Hobbs his life in Latine
which I beleeve will be a very vendible booke both here
and beyond sea, for ther is noe lover of learning but will
have the curiosity to be particularly informed of the life
of soe eminent a person. And truly the reading of it wase
very satisfactory to me, for in my apprehension it is very
well writ, but I cou'd have wish'd the author had more
dilated upon some particulars; and because you intimate
a designe to publish it in English I shall hint to you that
the author of the life in Latine hath either not taken notice
of at all, or too slightingly, some things very remarkeable
relating to the temper of Mr. Hobbs his mind or to the
infirmity of his body, as his extraordinary timorousnes
which he himself in his Latine poem doth very ingeniously
confess and attributes it to the influence of his mother's
dread of the Spanish invasion in 88, she being then with
child of him. And I have been informed, I think by your
self, that Mr. Hobbs wase for severall yeares before he died
soe paralyticall that he wase scarce able to write his name,
and that in the absence of his amanuensis not being able to
write anything he made scrawls on a piece of paper to
remind him of the conceptions of his mind he design'd
to have committed to writing. But the author<a name="FNanchor_1994" id="FNanchor_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a> of his
life in Latine only sa&lt;i&gt;th that about 60 yeares of age
he wase taken with a trembling in his hands, the forerunner
of the palsy; which in my apprehension deserves to be
enlarg'd upon, for it is very prodigious that neither the
timorousness of his nature from his infancy, nor the decay
of his vital heat in the extremity of old age, accompagnied
with the palsy to that violence, shou'd not have chill'd the
briske fervour and vigour of his mind, which did wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>fully
continue to him to his last; which is a subject fit
to be discours'd on by a genious equally philosophicall
with Mr. Hobbs, wase that now to be hoped for. It is
soe considerable to me that I cou'd not refrayne acquainting
you that in my apprehension it wase convenient you tooke
notice therof in his life you are setting forth in English.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_290" id="Footnote_290"></a><a href="#FNanchor_290"><span class="label">[FF]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_323">323</a>.) On fol. 29<sup>v</sup> of MS. Aubr. 9, Anthony Wood notes:&mdash;'Send to
Malmsburie to take out of the register the Christian name of Mr. Hobs' father,
when Mr. Hobbs was borne, or when his said father was buried.' [On this Aubrey
notes:&mdash;'As I remember he dyed at Thistleworth; vide the register booke at
Thistleworth, where Mr. Hobbes his father lived in obscurity a reader, and
there dyed about 1630.'] Wood goes on:&mdash;'I remember when I was there'
&lt;in 1676, Clark's Wood's <i>Life and Times</i>, ii. 410, 411&gt; 'there were two
inscriptions of the Hobs on brass plates; one dyed 1606, quaere. Take out
the names of all the Hobs in the register.' Obedient to this advice, Aubrey
sent his brother William to Malmesbury: <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_387">387</a>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_291" id="Footnote_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_291"><span class="label">[FG]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_323">323</a>.) In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 26, Aubrey puts the substance of this
paragraph in a neater form:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Hobbes' father was minister of Westport, to which Brokenborough and
Charlton doe belong as chapells of ease, but all not worth above.... He
was one of the clergie of Queen Elizabeth's time&mdash;a little learning went a great
way with him and many other Sir Johns in those days&mdash;he read homilies.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_292" id="Footnote_292"></a><a href="#FNanchor_292"><span class="label">[FH]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_323">323</a>.) On fol. 30 of MS. Aubr. 9 is another draft of this paragraph:&mdash;'He
had an elder brother, Francis Hobbes, a wealthy man, and had been
alderman of the borough' (dupl. with 'towne'); 'by profession a glover, which
is a great trade here and was heretofore greater. He was <i>orbus</i>. He contributed
much, or altogether maintained his nephew Thomas at Magdalen Hall
in Oxon; and when he dyed gave him an <i>agellum</i> (vocat. "the Gasten"),

<p><a name="Footnote_294" id="Footnote_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_294"><span class="label">[FJ]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_326">326</a>.) In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31<sup>v</sup>, Anthony Wood suggests the following
paragraph for the transition from the account of Malmsbury to the life of
Hobbes:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'As Malmsbury was famous in this respect that it gave death and buriall to
that famous philosopher of his time Johannes Scotus <i>alias</i> Erigina who was
stabd to death with penknives by his scholars, where there was a statue set up
in memory of him (ut in <i>Hist. et Antiq. Oxon.</i> lib. 1, pag. 16 <i>b</i>), so much more
famous in later times for the birth of that great philosopher T. H.'
</p>
<p>
In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28, Aubrey begins his sketch of Hobbes' life thus:&mdash;'Westport
juxta Malmesbury:&mdash;This place is for nothing so famous as for the
birth of my honoured and learned friend and countryman, Mr. Thomas Hobbes,
author of <i>de Corpore</i>, <i>de Homine</i>, <i>de Cive</i>, etc.
</p>
<p>
He was borne the 5th day of Aprill 1588 at his father's howse, which is the
farthest on the left hand as you goe in the way or street called ..., leaving
the church on the right hand.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_295" id="Footnote_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_295"><span class="label">[FK]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_326">326</a>.) The verses alluded to are in Hobbes's metrical life of himself
(MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28&mdash;'he writt his life last yeare, viz. 1673, in Latin verse').
Aubrey cites these lines, MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31<sup>v</sup>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'T.H. <i>Vita</i> in verse
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p>
Vide mapp' &lt;perhaps Speed's map of Wiltshire: but on a slip at fol. 31<sup>v</sup>,
Aubrey gives a 'map' of Malmesbury: see <i>supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_325">325</a>, 326&gt;.
</p>
<p>
On this Anthony Wood comments: 'See 1 vol. of <i>Monast. Anglican.</i> concerning
the monastery.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_296" id="Footnote_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296"><span class="label">[FL]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_326">326</a>.) The matter of this paragraph is put a little more clearly in MS.
Aubr. 3, fol. 28: 'Westport juxta Malmesbury:&mdash;The church was dedicated to
St. Mary. Here were three aisles<a name="FNanchor_1996" id="FNanchor_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> which tooke up the whole area. And &lt;the
church was&gt; reported to be more ancient then the abbey. In the windowes
(which were very good) were inscriptions which declared so much. Quaere, if
Madulph the Scottsman taught here&mdash;unde origo monasterii? Vide Camdenum
de hoc.
</p>
<p>
Before the late warres here was a prettie church, where were very good
windowes and a faire steeple, higher than the other, which much adorned the
towne of Malmesbury. In it were five tuneable bells, which Sir William
Waller or his army melted into ordinance, or rather sold. The church was
pulled downe that the enimie might not shelter themselves against the garrison
of Malmesbury.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_297" id="Footnote_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_297"><span class="label">[FM]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_328">328</a>.) Aubrey's <i>Collection of Genitures</i> is now MS. Aubr. 23. The
place Aubrey here refers to is fol. 52<sup>v</sup> in that MS., viz.:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury borne at Westport juxta Malmesbury
1588, April 5, being Good Fryday, 5<sup>h</sup> 2&acute; mane, hor&acirc; solis' &lt;i.e. at sunrise&gt;.
'I had the yeare, and day, and houre from his owne mouth.'
</p>
<p>
Aubrey in several places recurs to this point, e.g. in MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me that he was borne Apr. 5<sup>th</sup> 1588 on Good
Fryday, in the morning between 4 and six.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_298" id="Footnote_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298"><span class="label">[FN]</span></a> (P. <a href="#Page_328">328</a>.) Aubrey took great interest in this as an example in astrology,
in which 'art' he thoroughly believed. He alludes to Hobbes's horoscope
in several places, e.g. note on fol. 32<sup>v</sup> in MS. Aubr. 9:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Dr. &lt;Francis&gt; Bernard, physitian, will write a discourse on his nativity.
Mr. John Gadbury hath calculated this nativity from my time given, and will
print it. Why should not I insert' &lt;dupl. with 'print'&gt; 'the scheme and give
a summary of his judgement? It would be gratefull to those that love that
art.' Whereon Anthony Wood notes&mdash;'You should never ask these questions
but do them out of hand forthwith&mdash;you have time enough, and if it be done
by Easter terme 'tis well.'
</p>
<p>
MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 28:&mdash;'&lt;Send&gt; to Mr. J. Gadbury and Dr. Bernard &lt;T. H.'s&gt;
accidents.'
</p>
<p>
MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 8:&mdash;'T. Hobbes&mdash;Quaere Dr. Bernard pro his nativity:
vide my Collection of Genitures ubi from his owne mouth more correct then
formerly, viz. 5<sup>h</sup> 2&acute; mane.'
</p>
<p>
This horoscope is given in MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 82, and is reproduced in facsimile
at the end of this edition.
</p>
<p>
Pasted on to fol. 1<sup>v</sup> of MS. Aubr. 9 is the scheme with this note:&mdash;'This
scheme was erected according to the aestimate time by Mr. Henry Coley,
astrologer.&mdash;Thomas Hobbes, Malmesburiensis, borne at Westport juxta
Malmesbury, 1588, April 5, being Good Fryday, 5<sup>h</sup> 2&acute; mane, hora solis<a name="FNanchor_1997" id="FNanchor_1997"></a><a href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a>.

Hobbes went to schoole in Westport church till 8&mdash;then[1675] the church was

After, he went to Malmesbury to parson Evans.

After him, he had for his schoolemaster, Mr. Robert Latimer<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[CXXIX.]</a>,
a good Graecian; by whom he so well profited that at 14
yeares old he went a good scholler to Magdalen Hall in Oxford.'</p></div>

doubt as to which 'Principal of Magdalen Hall' recommended
Hobbes to the earl of Devonshire's service. In MS. Aubr. 9,
fol. 29, is the note:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Take notice of Dr. Blackburne's altering some times and dates,' &lt;in Hobbes'
prose Latin life of himself, prefixed to the <i>Auctarium vitae Hobbianae</i>&gt; 'differing
from this originall, e.g. of Mr. Hobbes being admitted at Magdalen Hall when
Sir James Hussey was principall, which he would doe against my consent
because he sayd it "would make a better picture," wheras by the matriculation-booke
it appeares that Dr. Wilkinson was then the principall.'</p></div>

account of Gorhambury:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Memorandum in my Liber B<a name="FNanchor_1998" id="FNanchor_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a>. I have sett downe an exact description of this
delicious parquet<a name="FNanchor_1999" id="FNanchor_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a>, now (1656) plowed up and spoil'd. The east part of it
which extends towards Verulam-house (pulled downe, and the materialls sold by
Sir H&lt;arbottle&gt; Grimston, about ten yeares since) consisted of severall parts,
viz. some thickets of plumme-trees, with fine walkes between; some of rasberies.
Here were planted most fruit-trees which would grow in our climate; and also
severall choice forest-trees. The walkes both of boscages and fruit-trees; and
in severall places where were the best prospects, were built elegant summerhouses<a name="FNanchor_2000" id="FNanchor_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a>
of Roman architecture, then standing (1656) well<a name="FNanchor_2001" id="FNanchor_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> wainscotted, but the
paving gonne. One would have thought the most barbarous nation had made
a conquest here. This place was, in his lordship's time, a sanctuary for phesants,
partridges, and those of severall kinds and nations, as Spanish, &amp;c. speckled,
white, etc. I have, in this lib. B., four leves in fol. close written of the two
houses, gardens, woods, &amp;c. and of his lordship's manner of living and grandarie,
which perhaps would doe well in a description of Hartfordshire, or, perhaps<a name="FNanchor_2002" id="FNanchor_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a>,

treatise: Wood MS. F. 39, fol. 196<sup>v</sup>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'The old gent. (T. Hobbes) is strangely vigorous, for his understanding, still;
and every morning walkes abroad to meditate.
</p>
<p>
'He haz writt a treatise concerning lawe, which 8 or 9 yeares since I much
importuned him to doe, and, in order to it, gave him the Lord Chancellor
Bacon's <i>Maximes of the Lawe</i>. Now every one will doe him the right to
acknowledge he is rare for definitions, and the lawyers building on old-fashiond
maximes (some right, some wrong) must need fall into severall paralogismes.
Upon this consideration I was earnest with him to consider these things. To
which he was unwilling, telling me he doubted he should not have dayes
enough left to doe it.

'He drives on, in this, the king's prerogative high. Judge &lt;Sir Matthew&gt;

makes use of this verdict on the innate cruelty of some dispositions. He puts
into the mouth of his country-justice this speech:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"If ye talke of skinnes, the best judgment to be made of the fineness of
skinnes is at the whipping-post by the stripes. Ah! 'tis the best lechery to see

<p>
'Hobbes brought to the investigation of facts an acute intellect and long
experience, and carried on, into the next generation, the Baconian spirit.
</p>
<p>
'He had been Bacon's secretary, and owed much to his master, from whom,
in particular, he borrowed his comparative, i.e. inductive, methods. But he
had also fine natural gifts.
</p>
<p>
'He excited the fears, and therefore the hostility, of the clerical party in
England, and of the Oxford mathematicians and their supporters. For this
reason, Charles II compared him to a bear, worried by mastiffs.
</p>
<p>
'In his political system, he insisted on the necessity of wisdom in sovereigns.
In not meddling with the Creeds of the Churches and in assailing the Presbyterians
and the Bishops of England, he is not to be blamed.'</p></div></div>

in my hands, which he sent for about two yeares before

<h5>&lt;<i>Hobbes' autobiography.</i>&gt;</h5>

<p><a name="FNanchor_2005" id="FNanchor_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a>Thomas Hobbes, natus Apr. 5, 1588, Malmesburiae
agri Wiltoniensis, literis Latinis et Graecis initiatus, annum
agens decimum quartum missus est Oxonium: ubi per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>quinquennium mansit, operam impendens studio Logicae
et Physicae Aristotelicae.</p>

<p>Cum annum ageret vicesimum commendatus ab amicis,
Oxonio relicto, recepit se in domum domini Gulielmi
Cavendish, baronis de Hardwick et (paulo post) comitis
Devoniae: ubi filio ejus primogenito, adolescenti sibi fere
coaetaneo, servivit, placuitque tum filio tum patri, temperans,
sedulus, hilaris.</p>

<p>Anno sequente cum domino suo in urbe perpetuo fere
degens, quod didicerat linguae Graecae et Latinae magna
ex parte amiserat.</p>

<p>Deinde per Italiam et Galliam peregrinantem dominum
sequutus, gentium illarum linguas eousque didicit ut
intelligere eas mediocriter potuerit. Interea Graecam et
Latinam paulatim perire sibi sentiens, Philosophiam autem
Logicamque (in quibus praeclare profecisse se arbitrabatur)
viris prudentibus derisui esse videns, abjecta Logica et
Philosophia illa vana, quantum temporis habebat vacui
impendere decrevit linguis Graecae et Latinae.</p>

<p>Itaque cum in Angliam reversus esset, Historias et
Poetas (adhibitis grammaticorum celebrium commentariis)
versavit diligenter, non ut floride sed ut Latine posset
scribere, et vim verborum cogitatis congruentem invenire,
itaque verba disponere ut lectio perspicua et facilis esset.
Inter Historias Graecas, Thucididem prae caeteris dilexit
et vacuis horis in sermonem Anglicum paulatim conversum
cum nonnull&acirc; laude circa annum Christi 1628
in publicum edidit, eo fine ut ineptiae democraticorum
Atheniensium concivibus suis patefierent.</p>

<p>Eo anno comes Devoniae, cui jam servierat viginti annos,
diem obiit, patre ejus biennio ante defuncto.</p>

<p>Anno sequente, qui erat Christi 1629, cum attigisset
annum quadragesimum, rogatus a nobilissimo viro domino
Gervasio Clinton ut vellet filium adolescentem suum
comitari in Galliam, accepit conditionem. In peregrinatione
illa inspicere coepit in elementa Euclidis; et delectatus
methodo illius non tam ob theoremata illa quam ob
artem rationandi diligentissime perlegit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Anno Christi 1631 revocatus est in familiam comitissae
Devoniae ut filium suum comitem Devoniae, natum annos
13, in literis instrueret; quem etiam circiter triennium
post comitatus est in Galliam et Italiam, studiorum ejus
et itinerum rector.</p>

<p>Dum moraretur Parisiis, principia scientiae naturalis
investigare coepit. Quae cum in natura et varietate
motuum contineri sciret, quaesivit inprimis qualis motus is
esse posset qui efficit sensionem, intellectum, phantasmata,
aliasque proprietates animalium, cogitatis suis cum reverendo
patre Marino Mersenno, ordinis Minimorum, in omni
genere philosophiae versatissimo viroque optimo, quotidie
communicatis.</p>

<p>Anno Christi 1637 cum patrono suo in Angliam rediit et
apud illum mansit; unde de rebus naturalibus commercia
cum Mersenno per literas continuavit.</p>

<p>Interea Scoti, depulsis episcopis, sumpserunt arma contra
regem, faventibus etiam ministris Anglis illis qui vocari
solent Presbyteriani. Itaque convocatum est in Anglia
Parlamentum illud notissimum quod inceptum est Nov. 3,
1640. Ex iis quae in illo Parlamento tribus quatuorve
diebus primis consulta viderat, Bellum Civile ingruere et
tantum non adesse sentiens, retulit se rursus in Galliam,
scientiarum studio Parisiis tutius vacaturus cum Mersenno,
Gassendo, aliisque viris propter eruditionem et vim in
rationando celeberrimis&mdash;non enim dico philosophis, quia
nomen illud, a plurimis nebulonibus jamdiu gestatum,
tritum, inquinatum, nunc infame est.</p>

<p>Cum jam Parisiis ageret, libellum scripsit <i>De Cive</i>, quem
edidit anno 1646, quo tempore, praevalentibus Parlamentariis,
multi eorum qui partes regis sequuti erant, et in illis
princeps Walliae (qui nunc est rex Angliae), Parisiis confluxerunt.
Statuerat circa idem tempus,<a name="FNanchor_2006" id="FNanchor_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a>hortatu amici
cujusdam nobilis Languedociani, migrare in Languedociam,
et praemiserat jam quae sibi necessaria erant, sed commendatus
principi ut elementa Mathematicae illi praelegeret,
substit&lt;it&gt; Parisiis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>
<p>Quod ab hoc munere temporis habuit vacui consumpsit
in scribendo librum qui nunc non solum in Anglia sed in
vicinis gentibus notissimus est, nomine <i>Leviathan</i>; quem
etiam in Anglia edendum curavit, ipse manens adhuc
Parisiis, anno 1651, annum agens 63<sup>m</sup>. In eo opere jus
regium tum spirituale tum temporale ita demonstravit tum
rationibus tum authoritate scripturae sacrae, ut perspicuum
fecerit pacem in orbe Christiano nusquam diuturnam esse
posse nisi vel doctrina illa sua recepta fuerit vel satis magnus
exercitus cives ad concordiam compulerit: opus ut ille
sperabat concivibus suis, praesertim vero illis qui ab episcopis
steterant, non ingratum. Quanquam enim unicuique,
illo tempore, scribere et edere theologica quae vellet liberum
erat, quia regimen ecclesiae (potestate declarandi quae
doctrinae essent haereses, ipsius regis authoritate sublata,
episcopis exutis, rege ipso trucidato) tum nullum erat, diligenter
tamen cavit ne quid scriberet non modo contra
sensum scripturae sacrae sed etiam contra doctrinam
ecclesiae Anglicanae qualis ante bellum ortum authoritate
regia constituta fuerat. Nam et ipse regimen ecclesiae per
episcopos prae caeteris formis omnibus semper approbaverat,
atque hoc duobus signis manifestum fecit. Primo, cum in
oppido Sti. Germani prope Parisios morbo gravissimo lecto
affixus esset, venit ad eum Mersennus, rogatus a quodam
amico communi ne amicum suum extra ecclesiam Romanam
mori pateretur. Is lecto assidens (post exordium consolatorium)
de potestate ecclesiae Romanae peccata remittendi
aliquantisper disseruit, cui ille 'Mi pater,' inquit. 'haec
omnia jamdudum mecum disputavi, eadem disputare nunc
molestum erit: habes quod dicas amoeniora,&mdash;quando
vidisti Gassendum?' Quibus auditis, Mersennus sermonem
ad alia transtulit. Paucis post diebus accessit ad illum
Dr. Johannes Cosenus, episcopus (post) Dunelmensis, obtulitque
se illi comprecatorem ad Deum. Cui ille cum gratias
reddidisset, 'Ita,' inquit, 'si precibus praeiveris juxta ritum
ecclesiae nostrae.' Magnum hoc erga disciplinam episcopalem
signum erat reverentiae.</p>

<p>Anno 1651 exemplaria aliquot illius libri, Londini recens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
editi, in Galliam transmissa sunt, ubi theologi quidam
Angli doctrinas quasdam in illo libro contentas, tum ut
haereticas tum ut partibus regiis adversas, criminati sunt;
et valuere quidem aliquamdiu calumniae illae in tantum ut
domo regia prohibitus fuerit. Quo factum est ut, protectione
regia destitutus, metuensque ne a clericis Romanis,
quos praecipue laeserat, male tractaretur, in Angliam conatus
sit refugere.</p>

<p>Rediens in Angliam concionantes quidem invenit in
ecclesiis sed seditiosos; etiam preces extemporarias, et illas
audaces et nonnunquam blasphemas; symbolum autem
fidei nullum, decalogum nullum; adeo ut per tres primos
menses non invenerit quibuscum in sacris communicare
potuerit. Tandem ab amico ductus ad ecclesiam a suo
hospitio<a name="FNanchor_2007" id="FNanchor_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> plusquam mille passus distantem ubi pastor erat
vir bonus et doctus, qui et coenam Domini ritu ecclesiastico
administravit, cum illo in sacris communicavit. Alterum
hoc signum erat non modo hominis partium episcopalium
sed etiam Christiani sinceri; nam illo tempore ad ecclesiam
quamcunque legibus aut metu cogebatur nemo. Quae
igitur episcopo cuiquam cum illo causa irae esse potuit,
nisi ei qui neminem a se dissentire pati per superbiam
posset?</p>

<p>Interea doctrinam ejus academici et ecclesiastici condemnabant
fere omnes; laudabant nobiles, et viri docti, ex
laicis. Refellebat nemo: conati refellere, confirmabant.
Scripsit enim non ex auditione et lectione ut scholaris, sed
ex judicio proprio cognita et pensitata omnia, sermone
puro et perspicuo, non rhetorico. Stantem inter amicos et
inimicos quasi in aequilibrio, fecerunt illi ne ob doctrinam
opprimeretur, hi, ne augeretur. Itaque fortuna tenui, fama
doctrinae ingenti, in patroni sui, comitis Devoniae, hospitio
per caeterum vitae tempus perpetuo delituit, studio vacans
geometriae et philosophiae naturalis; ediditque jam senex
librum quendam quem inscripsit <i>De Corpore</i>, continentem
Logicae, Geometriae, Physicae (tum sublunaris, tum coelestis)
fundamenta, deducens Logicam quidem a significatione<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
nominum, Geometriam autem et Physicam ex figurarum
et effectuum naturalium generationibus.</p>

<p>Hominis ergo neque genere neque opibus neque negotiis
belli aut pacis assueti vitam scribo et in publicum emitto,
sed in omni genere scientiae excellentis et fere singularis.
Cujus ingenium ut cognoscerent, partim etiam ut sua ostentarent,
convenerunt &lt;ad&gt; eum viri innumeri tum nostrates
tum exteri, et inter illos nonnulli legati principum aliique
viri nobilissimi; adeo ut conjectura inde facta de voluntate
hominum eruditorum qui posthac erunt, non ingratum fore
posteritati existimavi si quem vidisse voluerunt illius vitam
literis posteritati tradiderim, praecipue quidem ut quae
scientiis ille primus addidit, deinde etiam caetera vitae ejus
quae a lectoribus desiderari posse videbuntur cognoscerent.</p>

<p>Quae scripsit de jure naturali, de constitutione civitatum,
de jure eorum qui summam habent potestatem, et de
officiis civium, in libris <i>Leviathan</i> et <i>De Cive</i> (quia domi
forisque nota et maxime celebrata sunt) praetereunda
censeo.</p>

<p>In Physicis causam sensuum, praecipue visus, una cum
doctrina omni optica et natura lucis, refractionis reflectionisque
causas naturales, ignotas ante, primus demonstravit,
in libro <i>De Homine</i>. Item causas qualitatum sensibilium
nimirum colorum, soni, caloris, et frigoris. Somnia autem
et phantasmata quae antea pro spiritibus et mortuorum
animis habebantur et rudi vulgo terriculamenta erant,
omnia profligavit. Causam autem aestuum marinorum et
descensionis gravium, a motu quodam telluris praecipue
derivavit. Nam phaenomena illa omnia ad motum refert,
non ad rerum ipsarum potentias intrinsecas neque ad qualitates
occultas, ut ante illum omnes physici. De motu
autem in libro <i>De Corpore</i> satis fuse scripsit et profundissime.
In Ethicis ante illum nihil scriptum est praeter
sententias vulgares. At ille mores hominum ab humana
natura, virtutes et vitia a lege naturali, et bonitatem<a name="FNanchor_2008" id="FNanchor_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a>
maliciamque actionum a legibus civitatum, derivavit. In
Mathematicis principia geometriae nonnulla correxit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
problemata aliquot difficillima, a summis geometris (ab
ipsis geometriae incunabulis) summo studio frustra quaesita,
invenit, nimirum haec&mdash;</p>

<p>1&ordm;. arcui circuli lineam rectam, areae circuli quadratum
aequale, exhibere, idque variis methodis&mdash;in diversis
libris.</p>

<p>2&ordm;. datum angulum dividere in data ratione;</p>

<p>7&ordm;. centra gravitatis invenire paraboli-formium omnium,

<p>Haec omnia primus construxit et demonstravit, et praeterea
alia multa quae (quia legentibus occurrent et minoris
sunt) praetereo.</p>

<p>Facient opinor haec ut vita ejus non indigna videatur

<h3><b>William Holder</b> (1616-1697/8).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_2010" id="FNanchor_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a>William Holder<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[FY]</a>, D.D., the ...d son<a name="FNanchor_2011" id="FNanchor_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a> of ... Holder;
his mother's mayden name was Brudenell. He was borne
the ... in Nottinghamshire; went to schoole at ...;
went to Pembroke-hall<a name="FNanchor_2012" id="FNanchor_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> in Cambridge, where he had
a Greeke-scholar's place. Anno &lt;1636/7&gt;, Artium Baccalaureus;
anno &lt;1640&gt; Artium Magister.</p>

<p>About 1640, he maried ... the ... daughter of
&lt;Christopher&gt; Wren, deane of Windsore and rector of
Knowyll in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 1642, had his institution and induction for
the rectorie of Bletchington in com. Oxon.</p>

<p>In the troublesome times he was with his father-in-lawe
Wren at the garrison of Bristowe. After the surrender of
it to the Parliament, he lived ... year at Knowyll
with him.</p>

<p>Anno about 1646<a name="FNanchor_2013" id="FNanchor_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a>, he went to Bletchington to his
parsonage, where his hospitality and learning, mixt with
great courtesie, easily conciliated the love of all his
neighbours to him. The deane came with him thither,
and dyed and is buryed there.</p>

<p>He was very helpfull in the education of his brother-in-law,
Mr. Christopher Wren (now knighted), a youth of
a prodigious inventive witt, and of whom he was as tender
as if he had been his owne child, who<a name="FNanchor_2014" id="FNanchor_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> gave him his first
instructions in geometrie and arithmetique, and when he
was a young scholar at the University of Oxford, was
a very necessary and kind friend.</p>

<p>The parsonage-house at Bletchington was Mr. Christopher
Wren's home, and retiring-place; here he contemplated,
and studied, and found-out a great many curious things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>in mathematiques. About this house<a name="FNanchor_2015" id="FNanchor_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> he made severall
curious dialls, with his owne handes, which are still there
to be seen. &#9758; Which see, as well worthy to be seen.</p>

<p>But to returne to this honest worthy gentleman&mdash;he is
a good poet. I have some very good verses (about 100)
in Latin on St. Vincent's-rocks and the hott-well, neere
Bristowe. He is very musicall, both theorically and
practically, and he had a sweet voyce. He hath writt an
excellent treatise of musique, in English, which is writt
both <i>doctis et indoctis</i>, and readie for the presse. He is
extremely well qualified for his<a name="FNanchor_2016" id="FNanchor_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a>place, of Sub-Deane of
the King's Chapell, to which he was preferred<a name="FNanchor_2017" id="FNanchor_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a> anno
167&lt;4&gt;, as likewise of the Sub-Almoner, being a person
abhorring covetousnes, and full of pitty<a name="FNanchor_2018" id="FNanchor_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a>.</p>

<p>Anno 16&mdash;(vide his ...) ... Popham (the only son of ...
Popham, admirall for the Parliament), being borne
deafe and dumbe<a name="FNanchor_2019" id="FNanchor_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a>, was sent to him to learne to speake,
which he taught him to doe: by what method, and how
soon, you may see in the Appendix concerning it to his
<i>Elements of Speech</i>, 8vo, London, printed &lt;1669&gt;. It is
a most ingeniose and curious discourse, and untouched by
any other; he was beholding to no author; did only
consult with nature. This booke I sent to Mr. Anthony
Lucas, at Liege, who very much admires it and I have
desired him to translate it into French. Dr. John Wallis
unjustly arrogates the glory of teaching the sayd young
gentleman to speake, in the Philosophical Transactions,
and in Dr. Robert Plott's History of Oxfordshire; which
occasioned Dr. Holder to write a ... against him, a
pamphlet in 4to, 167-.</p>

<p>He has good judgement in painting and drawing.</p>

<p>In anno &lt;1652&gt; he was made a prebendary of Ely.
Anno &lt;1663&gt; had the parsonage of &lt;Northwold&gt; in
Norfolk.</p>

<p>He is a handsome, gracefull person, and of a delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>constitution, and of an even and smooth temper; so that,
if one would goe about to describe a perfect good man,
would drawe this Doctor's character. Of a just stature;
grey eie; tall and well-sett; sanguine; thin skin; roundish
face; gracefull elocution; his discourse so gent. and
obligeing; cleer reason.</p>

<p>They say that <i>morum similitudo conci&lt;li&gt;at amicitiam</i>;
then it will not be found strange that there should be such
a conjunct friendship between this worthy gentleman and
the right reverend father in God, Seth Ward, lord bishop
of Sarum, his coetanean in Cambridge.</p>

<p>It ought not to be forgott the great and exemplary love
between this Doctor and his vertuose wife, who is not lesse
to be admired, in her sex and station, then her brother
Sir Christopher; and (which is rare to be found in a woman)
her excellences doe not inflate her. Amongst many other
guifts she haz a strange sagacity as to curing of wounds,
which she does not doe so much by presedents and reciept
bookes, as by her owne excogitancy, considering the causes,
effects, and circumstances. His majestie king Charles II,
167-, had hurt his ... hand, which he intrusted his
chirurgians to make well; but they ordered him so that
they made it much worse, so that it swoll, and pained him
up to his shoulder; and pained him so extremely that he
could not sleep, and began to be feaverish. ... told the
king what a rare shee-surgeon he had in his house; she
was presently sent for at eleven clock at night. She
presently made ready a pultisse, and applyed it, and gave
his majestie sudden ease, and he slept well; next day she
dressed him, and in ... perfectly cured him, to the great
griefe of all the surgeons, who envy and hate her.</p>

he was descended of the family of the earles of Kent, etc.,

<h3><b>Wenceslaus Hollar</b> (1607-1677).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_2024" id="FNanchor_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a>Winceslaus Hollar, natus Pragae 23 Julii, st&lt;ilo&gt;
v&lt;etere&gt;, 1607, about 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_2025" id="FNanchor_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a>Winceslaus Hollar, Bohemus, was borne at Prague.</p>

<p>His father was a Knight of the Empire: which is by
lettres patent under the imperiall seale (as our baronets).
I have seen it<a name="FNanchor_2026" id="FNanchor_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a>: the seale is bigger then the broad seale of
England: in the middle is the imperiall coate; and round
about it are the coates of the Princes Electors. His father
was a Protestant, and either for keeping a conventicle, or
being taken at one, forfeited his estate, and was ruined by
the Roman Catholiques.</p>

<p>He told me that when he was a schoole-boy he tooke
a delight in draweing of mapps; which draughts he kept,
and they were pretty. He was designed by his father to
have been a lawyer, and was putt to that profession<a name="FNanchor_2027" id="FNanchor_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a>, when
his father's troubles, together with the warres, forced him
to leave his countrey. So that what he did for his delight
and recreation only when a boy, proved to be his livelyhood
when a man.</p>

<p>I thinke he stayd sometime in Lowe Germany, then he
came into England, wher he was very kindly entertained
by that great patron of painters and draughts-men &lt;Thomas
Howard&gt; Lord High Marshall, earl of Arundell and Surrey,
where he spent his time in draweing and copying rarities,
which he did etch (i.e. eate with aqua fortis in copper
plates). When the Lord Marshall went ambassador to the
Emperor of Germany to Vienna, he travelld with much
grandeur; and among others, Mr. Hollar went with him
(very well clad) to take viewes, landskapes, buildings, etc.
remarqueable in their journey, which wee see now at the
print shopps.</p>

<p>He hath donne the most in that way that ever any one
did, insomuch that I have heard Mr. John Evelyn, R.S.S.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>say that at sixpence a print his labour would come to ...
<i>li.</i> (quaere J&lt;ohn&gt; E&lt;velyn&gt;). He was very short-sighted
(&#956;&#965;&#959;&#968;<a name="FNanchor_2028" id="FNanchor_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a>), and did worke so curiously that the curiosity
of his worke is not to be judged without a magnifying-glasse.
When he tooke his landskaps, he, then, had a glasse
to helpe his sight.</p>

<p>At Arundel-house he maried with my ladle's wayting
woman, Mrs. ... Tracy, by whom he haz a daughter,
that was one of the greatest beauties I have seen; his
son by her dyed in the plague, an ingeniose youth, drew
delicately.</p>

<p>When the civil warres brake-out, the Lord Marshall had
leave to goe beyond sea<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[CXXXI.]</a>. Mr. Hollar went
into the Lowe-Countries, where he stayed till
about 1649.</p>

<p>I remember he told me that when he first came into
England, (which was a serene time of peace) that the people,
both poore and rich, did looke cheerfully, but at his returne,
he found the countenances of the people all changed,
melancholy, spightfull, as if bewitched.</p>

<p>I have sayd before that his father was ruined upon the
account of the Protestant religion. Winceslaus dyed a
Catholique, of which religion, I suppose, he might be ever
since he came to Arundel-howse.</p>

<p>He was a very friendly good-natured man as could be,
but shiftlesse as to the world, and dyed not rich<a name="FNanchor_2030" id="FNanchor_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a>. He
maried a second wife, 1665, by whom he has severall
children. He dyed on our Ladie-day (25 Martii), 1677,
and is buried in St. Margaret's church-yard at Westminster
neer the north west corner of the tower. Had he lived till
the 13th of July following, he had been just 70 yeares old.</p>

quaere Dr. &lt;William&gt; Holder. He was of the family of
Hooke of Hooke in Hampshire, in the road from London to

(3 or more) hundred yeares.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_2038" id="FNanchor_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a>His father was minister of Freshwater in the Isle

at Freshwater aforesayd the nineteenth day of July, Anno
Domini 1635&mdash;vide register, et obiit patris.</p>

<p>At ... yeares old, John Hoskyns, the painter, being
at Freshwater, to drawe pictures for ... esqre, Mr. Hooke
observed what he did, and, thought he, 'why cannot I doe
so too?' So he getts him chalke, and ruddle, and coale,
and grinds them, and putts them on a trencher, gott a
pencill, and to worke he went, and made a picture: then
he copied<a name="FNanchor_2040" id="FNanchor_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> (as they hung up in the parlour) the pictures
there, which he made like. Also, being a boy there, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>Freshwater, he made an ... diall on a round trencher;
never having had any instruction. His father was not
mathematicall at all.</p>

<p>When his father dyed, his son Robert was but ... old,

apprentice to Mr. Lilly<a name="FNanchor_2041" id="FNanchor_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a>, the paynter, with whom he was

Mr. Hooke quickly perceived<a name="FNanchor_2042" id="FNanchor_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> what was to be donne, so,
thought he, 'why cannot I doe this by my selfe and keepe my
hundred pounds?' He also had some instruction in draweing
from Mr. Samuel Cowper (prince of limners of this age);
but whether from him before or after Mr. Lilly quaere?</p>

<p>&#9758; Quaere when he went to Mr. Busby's, the schoolemaster
of Westminster, at whose howse he was; and he
made very much of him. With him he lodged his C <i>li.</i><a name="FNanchor_2043" id="FNanchor_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a>
There he learnd to<a name="FNanchor_2044" id="FNanchor_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> play 20 lessons on the organ. He
there in one weeke's time made himselfe master of the
first <span class="smcap">VI</span> bookes of <i>Euclid</i>, to the admiration of Mr. Busby
(now S.T.D.), who introduced him. At schoole here he
was very mechanicall, and (amongst other things) he invented
thirty severall wayes of flying, which I have not only
heard him say, but Dr. Wilkins (at Wadham College at
that time), who gave him his <i>Mathematicall Magique</i>
which did him a great kindnes. He was never a King's
Scholar, and I have heard Sir Richard Knight (who
was his school-fellow) say that he seldome sawe him in
the schoole.</p>

<p>Anno Domini &lt;1658&gt; (vide A. Wood's <i>Antiq. Oxon.</i>)
he was sent to Christ Church in Oxford, where he had
a chorister's place (in those dayes when the church
musique was putt-downe<a name="FNanchor_2045" id="FNanchor_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a>), which was a pretty good
maintenance. He was there assistant to Dr. Thomas Willis
in his chymistry; who afterwards recommended him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>the hon<sup>ble</sup> Robert Boyle, esqre, to be usefull to him in
his chymicall operations. Mr. Hooke then read to him
(R. B., esqre) Euclid's Elements, and made him understand<a name="FNanchor_2046" id="FNanchor_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a>
Des Cartes' Philosophy. He was Master of Arts
anno Domini....</p>

<p>Anno Domini 166&lt;2&gt; Mr. Robert Boyle recommended
Mr. Robert Hooke to be Curator of the Experiments of
the Royall Society, wherin he did an admirable good worke
to the Common-wealth of Learning, in recommending the
fittest person in the world to them. Anno &lt;1664&gt; he was
chosen Geometry<a name="FNanchor_2047" id="FNanchor_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> Professour at Gresham College<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[GA]</a>. Anno
Domini 166- Sir John Cutler, knight, gave a Mechanicall
lecture, ... pounds per annum, which he read.</p>

<p>Anno Domini 166&lt;6&gt; the great conflagration of London
happened, and then he was chosen one of the
two surveyors<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[CXXXII.]</a> of the citie of London; by
which he hath gott a great estate. He built
Bedlam, the Physitians' College, Montague-house, the Piller
on Fish-street-hill, and Theatre there; and he is much
made use of in designing buildings.</p>

the glasse-painter,
was
the other.</p></div>

<p>He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale
faced, and his face but little belowe, but his head is lardge;
his eie full and popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He
haz a delicate head of haire, browne, and of an excellent
moist curle. He is and ever was very temperate, and
moderate in dyet, etc.</p>

<p>As he is of prodigious inventive head, so is a person of
great vertue and goodnes. Now when I have sayd his
inventive faculty is so great, you cannot imagine his memory
to be excellent, for they are like two bucketts, as one goes
up, the other goes downe. He is certainly the greatest
mechanick this day in the world. His head lies much
more to Geometry then to Arithmetique. He is (1680)
a batchelour, and, I beleeve, will never marie. His elder
brother left one faire daughter<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[GB]</a>, which is his heire. In fine
(which crownes all) he is a person of great suavity and
goodnesse.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hooke, R.S.S. did in anno 1670, write
a discourse, called, 'An Attempt to prove the motion of
the Earth,' which he then read to the Royal Society; but
printed it in the beginning of the yeare 1674, a <i>strena</i><a name="FNanchor_2050" id="FNanchor_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a> to
Sir John Cutler to whom it is dedicated, wherein he haz
delivered the theorie of explaining the coelestial motions
mechanically; his words are these, pag. 27, 28. viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>['In<a name="FNanchor_2051" id="FNanchor_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a>the <i>Attempt to prove the motion of the earth</i>, etc.,
printed 1674, but read to the Royall Society, 1671: pag.
27, line 31&mdash;</p>

<p>'I shall only for the present hint that I have in some of
my foregoing observations discovered some new motions
even in the Earth it self, which perhaps were not dreamt
of before, which I shall hereafter more at large describe,
when further tryalls have more fully confirmed and compleated
these beginnings. At which time also I shall
explaine a systeme of the world, differing in many particulars
from any yet known, answering in all things to
the common rules of mechanicall motions. This depends
upon 3 suppositions; first, that all coelestiall bodys whatsoever
have an attractive or gravitating power towards
their own centers, whereby they attract not only their
own parts, and keep them from flying from them, as we
may observe the Earth to doe, but that they doe also
attract all the other coelestial bodys that are within the
sphere of their activity, and consequently that not only the
Sun and the Moon have an influence upon the body and
motion of the Earth, and the Earth upon them, but that
Mercury also, Venus, Mars, Saturne, and Jupiter, by their
attractive powers have a considerable influence upon its
motion, as, in the same manner, the corresponding attractive
power of the Earth hath a considerable influence upon
every one of their motions also. The second supposition is
this, that all bodys whatsoever, that are putt into direct
and simple motion will soe continue to move forwards in
a straight line, till they are by some other effectuall powers
deflected and bent into a motion describing a circle,
ellipsis, or some other uncompounded curve line. The
third supposition is, that these attractive powers are soe
much the more powerfull in operating, by how much nearer
the body wrought upon is to their own centers. Now what
these severall degrees are, I have not yet experimentally
verified.'&mdash;<i>But these degrees and proportions of the power
of attraction in the celestiall bodys and motions, were com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>municated
to Mr. Newton by R. Hooke, in the yeare 1678,
by letters, as will plainely appear both by the coppys of the
said letters, and the letters of Mr. Newton in answer to
them, which are both in the custody of the said R. H., both
which also were read before the Royall Society at their
publique meeting, as appears by the Journall book of the
said Society.</i>&mdash;'But it is a notion which if fully prosecuted,
as it ought to be, will mightily assist the astronomer to reduce
all the coelestiall motions to a certaine rule, which I doubt
will never be done true without it. He that understands the
natures of the circular pendulum and circular motion, will
easily understand the whole ground of this principle, and
will know where to find direction in nature for the true stating
thereof. This I only hint at present to such as have ability
and opportunity of prosecuting this inquiry, and are not
wanting of industry for observing and calculating, wishing
heartily such may be found, having my self many other
things in hand, which I will first compleat, and therefore
cannot soe well attend (to) it. But this I durst promise
the undertaker; that he will find all the great motions of
the world to be influenced by this principle, and that the
true understanding thereof will be the true
perfection of Astronomy.']</p>

<p>About 9 or 10 years ago, Mr. Hooke writt to
Mr. Isaac Newton, of Trinity College, Cambridge,
to make<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[CXXXIII.]</a> a demonstration of this
theory, not telling him, at first, the proportion
of the gravity to the distance, nor what was the
curv'd line that was thereby made. Mr. Newton,
in his answer to the letter, did expresse that
he had not known<a name="FNanchor_2052" id="FNanchor_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a> of it; and in his first attempt
about it, he calculated the curve by supposing
the attraction to be the same at all distances:
upon which, Mr. Hooke sent, in his next letter,
the whole of his hypothesis, scil. that the
gravitation was reciprocall to the square of the distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
['which<a name="FNanchor_2053" id="FNanchor_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> would make the motion in an ellipsis, in one of
whose foci the sun being placed, the aphelion and perihelion
of the planet would be opposite to each other
in the same line, which is the whole coelestiall theory,
concerning which Mr. Newton hath a demonstration,']
not at all owning he receiv'd the first intimation of it
from Mr. Hooke. Likewise Mr. Newton haz in the same
booke printed some other theories and experiments of
Mr. Hooke's, as that about the oval figure of the earth
and sea: without acknowledgeing from whom he had
them, ['though1730<a href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> he had not sent it up with the other
parts of his booke till near a month after the theory was
read to the Society by Mr. Hooke, when it served to
help to answer Dr. Wallis his arguments produced in the
Royal Society against it.']</p>

<h3><b>John Hoskyns</b> (1566-1638).</h3>


<p><a name="FNanchor_2056" id="FNanchor_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a>John Hoskyns<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[GC]</a>, serjeant-at-lawe, was borne at Mounckton
in the parish of &lt;Llanwarne&gt; in the com. of Hereford,
A&ordm; D<sup>ni</sup> &lt;1566&gt; [on<a name="FNanchor_2057" id="FNanchor_2057"></a><a href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a> St. Mark's day].</p>

<p>Mounckton belonged to the priory of Llantony juxta
Glocester, where his ancestors had the office of cupbearer
(or 'pocillator') to the prior. I have heard there was
a windowe given by one Hoskyns there, as by the inscription
did appeare.</p>

<p>Whither the serjeant were the eldest brother<a name="FNanchor_2058" id="FNanchor_2058"></a><a href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> or no,
I have forgott; but he had a brother, John<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[GD]</a>, D.D., a learned
man, rector of Ledbury and canon of Hereford, who, I thinke,
was eldest, who was designed to be a scholar, but this John
(the serjeant) would not be quiet, but he must be a scholar
too. In those dayes boyes were seldome taught to read
that were not to be of some learned profession. So, upon his
instant importunity, being then ten yeares of age, he learned
to reade, and, at the yeare's end, entred into his Greeke
grammar. This I have heard his sonne, Sir Benet Hoskyns,
knight and baronett, severall times say.</p>

<p>He was of a strong constitution, and had a prodigious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>memorie. At ... yeares old, he went to Winton schole,
where he was the flower of his time. I remember I have
heard that one time he had not made his exercise (verse)
and spake to one of his forme to shew him his, which he sawe.
The schoolmaster presently calles for the exercises, and
Hoskyns told him that he had writ it out but lost it, but he
could repeate it, and repeated the other boye's exercise
(I think 12 or 16 verses) only at once reading over. When
the boy who really had made them shewed the master the
same, and could not repeate them, he was whipped for
stealing Hoskyns' exercise. I thinke John Owen<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[GE]</a> and
he were schoole-fellowes. There were many pretty stories
of him when a schooleboy, which I have forgott. I have
heard his son say that he was a yeare at Westminster; and
not speeding there, he was sent to Winton.</p>

<p>The Latin verses in the quadrangle at Winton Colledge<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[GF]</a>,
at the cocks where the boyes wash their hands, were of his
making, where there is the picture<a name="FNanchor_2059" id="FNanchor_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> of a good servant, with
hind's feet, ... head, a padlock on his lippes, ...
The Latin verses describe the properties of a good servant.</p>

<p>When he came to New College, he was <i>Terrae filius</i>;
but he was so bitterly satyricall that he was expelled and
putt to his shifts.</p>

<p>He went into Somersetshire and taught a schole for
about a yeare at Ilchester. He compiled there a Greeke
lexicon as far as M, which I have seen. He maried (neer
there) a rich widowe, [of Mr. Bourne]; she was a Moyle of
Kent; by whome he had only one sonne and one daughter.</p>

<p>[After<a name="FNanchor_2060" id="FNanchor_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> his mariage] he admitted himselfe at the Middle
Temple, London. He wore good cloathes, and kept good
company. His excellent witt gave him letters of commendacion
to all ingeniose persons. At his<a name="FNanchor_2061" id="FNanchor_2061"></a><a href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a>first comeing
to London he gott acquainted with the under-secretaries at
court, where he was often usefull to them in writing their
Latin letters.</p>

<p>His great witt quickly made him be taken notice of.</p>

<p>Ben: Johnson called him <i>father</i>. Sir Benet (bishop Benet<a name="FNanchor_2062" id="FNanchor_2062"></a><a href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a>
of Hereford was his godfather) told me that one time
desiring Mr. Johnson to adopt him for his sonne, 'No,'
said he, 'I dare not; 'tis honour enough for me to be your
brother: I was your father's sonne, and 'twas he that polished
me.' In shorte, his acquaintance were all the witts then about
the towne; e.g. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was his fellow-prisoner
in the Tower, where he was Sir Walter's <i>Aristarchus</i>
to reviewe and polish Sir Walter's stile; John Donne, D.D.;

<p>&lt;Richard&gt; Martyn, recorder of London; Sir Benjamin
Ruddyer, with whom it was once his fortune to have a
quarrell and fought a duell with him and hurt him in the
knee, but they were afterwards friends again; Sir Henry
Wotton, provost of Eaton College; cum multis aliis.</p>

<p>His conversation was exceedingly pleasant, and on the
roade he would make any one good company to him. He
was a great master of the Latin and Greke languages;
a great divine. He understood the lawe well, but worst
at that.</p>

<p>He was admitted at the Middle Temple anno ...;
called to be a serjeant at lawe anno &lt;1623&gt; (vide &lt;Sir
William Dugdale's&gt; <i>Origines Juridiciales</i>).</p>

<p>His verses on the fart in the Parliament house are
printed in some of the <i>Drolleries</i>. He had a booke of
poemes, neatly written by one of his clerkes, bigger then
Dr. Donne's poemes, which his sonn Benet lent to he knowes
not who, about 1653, and could never heare of it since.
Mr. Thomas Henshawe haz an excellent Latin copie in
rhythme in the prayse of ale of his.</p>

<p>He was a very strong man and active. He did the
pomado in the saddle of the third horse in his armour
(which Sir John Hoskins haz still) before William, earle
of Pembroke. He was about my heighth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>
<p>He had a very readie witt, and would make verses on
the roade, where he was the best company in the world.
In Sir H. Wotton's <i>Remaynes</i> are verses (dialogue) made
on the roade by him and Sir Henry. He made an antheme
(gett it) in English to be sung at Hereford Minster at the
assizes; but Sir Robert Harley (a great Puritan) was much
offended at it. He made the epitaph on &lt;Peter&gt; Woodgate
in New College cloysters. He made the best Latin epitaphs
of his time; amongst many others an excellent one on
&lt;Sir Moyle&gt; Finch, this earl of Winchelsey's grandfather,

<p>These verses with a little alteration are sett on his
monument.</p>

<p>Under severall venerable and shady oakes in the parke,
he had seates made; and where was a fine purling spring,
he did curbe it with stone.</p>

<p>This putts me in mind of Fr. Petrarch's villa in Italie,
which is not long since printed, where were such devises&mdash;vide
Tomasini <i>Petrarcha redivivus</i>, Lat., Amsterdam, 12mo.</p>

<p>Besides his excellent naturall memorie, he acquired the
artificiall way of memorie.</p>

<p>He wrote his owne life (which his grandsonne Sir John
Hoskyns, knight and baronet, haz), which was to shew
that wheras Plutarch, ..., ..., etc., had wrote the lives
of many generalles, etc., grandees, that he, or an active
man might, from a private fortune by his witt and industrie
attained to the dignity of a serjeant-at-lawe&mdash;but he should
have said that they must have parts like his too.&mdash;This
life I cannot borrowe.</p>

<p>He wrote severall treatises. Amongst others:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>a booke of style;</li>
<li>a method of the lawe (imperfect).</li>
</ul>

<p>His familiar letters were admirable.</p>

<p>He was a close prisoner in the Tower, tempore regis
Jacobi, for speaking too boldly in the Parliament house
of the king's profuse liberality to the Scotts. He made
a comparison of a conduit, whereinto water came, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
ran-out afarre-off. 'Now,' said he, 'this pipe reaches as
far as Edinborough.' He was kept a 'close prisoner'
there, i.e., his windowes were boarded up. Through a
small chinke he sawe once a crowe, and another time, a
kite; the sight whereof, he sayd, was a great pleasure to
him. He, with much adoe, obtained at length the favour
to have his little son Bennet to be with him; and he then
made this distich, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Parvule dum puer es, nee scis incommoda linguae,<br /></span>

<p><a name="FNanchor_2070" id="FNanchor_2070"></a><a href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a>I have heard that when he came out of the Tower, his
crest (before expressed) was graunted him, viz., 'a lyon's
head couped or, breathing fire.' The serjeant would say
jocosely that it was the only lyon's head in England that
tooke tobacco.</p>

<p>Not many moneths before his death (being at the assises
or sessions at Hereford) a massive countrey fellowe trod on
his toe, which caused a gangrene which was the cause of
his death. One Mr. Dighton<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[CXXXIV.]</a> of Glocester (an
experienced chirurgian who had formerly been
chirurgian in the warres in Ireland) was sent
for to cure him; but his skill and care could
not save him. His toes were first cutt-off.
The minister of his parish had a clubbe-foote
or feete (I think his name was Hugh). Said
he, 'Sir Hugh'&mdash;after his toes were cutt off&mdash;'I
must be acquainted with your shoemaker.'</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_318" id="Footnote_318"></a><a href="#FNanchor_318"><span class="label">[CXXXIV.]</span></a> Mr. Dighton
would oftentimes
say that he
generally
observ'd in the
Irish warres that
those men that
went to their
wenches the day
before the
battayle either
did dye upon
the spott or came
under his
handes. <i>Digitus
Dei!</i></p></div>

<p>Sir Robert Pye, attorney of the court of wardes, was his
neighbour, but there was no great goodwill between them&mdash;Sir
Robert was haughty. He happened to dye on Christmas
day: the newes being brought to the serjeant, said
he 'The devill haz a Christmas pye.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>
<p>He was a very strong man, and valiant, and an early
riser in the morning (scil., at four in the morning). He
was black-eyed and had black hayre.</p>

<p>He lies buried under an altar monument on the north
side of the choire of Dowr abbey in Herefordshire.</p>

<p>(In this abbey church of Dowre are two <i>frustum's</i> or
remaynders of mayled and crosse-legged monuments, one
sayd to be of a lord Chandois, th' other, the lord of
Ewyas-lacy. A little before I sawe them a mower had
taken one of the armes to whett his syth.)</p>
